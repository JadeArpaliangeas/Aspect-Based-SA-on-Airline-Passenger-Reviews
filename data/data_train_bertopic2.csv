28842,Spirit Airlines,1,Spirit Airlines customer review,2014-05-05,False,I feel that Spirit Airlines is in the business to nickle and dime a customer. These are the following reasons: Airline ticket may be reasonable but baggage cost $300 for 3 bags and 1 bag was a take on. Told to go online to save money for luggage prices however you had to pay additional money and/or join and pay for a membership this was not initially told to me beforehand. It was an additional $10 if you had not already printed your boarding pass plus if you wanted an assigned seat that was also an additional $15. The plane seats were horrible you could not recline in them how would your back feel flying from Baltimore to Vegas round-trip it was like standing up the entire time! Finally the bundle menu the prices were terrible and utilizing a credit card for a soda and cookies for $10 is ridiculous. Furthermore if your luggage was over 50lbs you are looking at an additional $80. Never again.,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,no,,,31676
65745,Emirates,6,"""not overly impressed with Emirates""",2017-02-24,False,"  Phuket to Dubai. Aircraft boarding was haphazard but everyone was boarded 10 minutes before departure time. There was then a delay of over 1 hour as a mother informed cabin crew that her son was unwell. Eventually they were all offloaded and the flight departed 75 minutes late. During the delay we were asked what we wanted for a meal, both first and second choices were unavailable. Eventually I ended up having the lunch instead of breakfast which meant that there was not much choice for lunch. Cabin crew service was hit and miss. Seat comfort was acceptable and far better than those on the A380. No amenity packs were offered. Arriving at Dubai late we had 20 minutes to catch the connecting flight which entailed using the rail link and with faulty lifts in the terminal we just made the connection. Discounting the delay, I was not overly impressed with Emirates and thought that the flight was poor value for money.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Phuket to Dubai,January 2017,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,2.0,no,Phuket,Dubai,72282
77685,China Southern Airlines,5,"""cannot recommend this airline""",2017-09-21,False,"  Frankfurt to Wuhan via Changsha / Guangzhou. Overall dissatisfactory experience on for the most part older aircraft with no touch screen and little legroom on the A330. Food on the long haul segment of the flight was relatively good, whilst English service was bad. Safety video is extremely old school. No English magazine on the long haul, then on the domestic flight they had one - bizarre! Changsha as a stopover was a disaster. Though checked luggage is forwarded, you have to leave the aircraft, go through immigration and landside security check, led by an employee who ""tries"" to lead the group. All this in a hurry to catch the same plane again. Back in the plane, one passenger seems to be missing. Stewardesses walk along the corridor 10 times (!) trying to count passengers with their manual counter (seems to be a China Southern thing - extremely annoying and unprofessional). NO info from crew or cockpit whatsoever (in English or Chinese) for 2 hours! After 2 hours water is served. Followed by take off shortly after. Also unnecessary long (roundabout) ways in Guangzhou Airport: while the plane lands at a domestic gate, a bus is provided for all travelers from Frankfurt, which brings you again to the international terminal, which is especially inconvenient when you have to catch a domestic onward flight. China Southern also disappoints by saving on drinks on domestic flights, meaning a bottle of water only! Sadly, I cannot recommend this airline and was expecting more from the many positive reviews lately.

A child cannot travel unaccompanied and the company has to take care of this when buying the ticket, the commissioners have to solve the problem and not just throw the problem for me to solve, dishonesty is the least bad of words to describe this absurdity, my daughter having to travel alongside 3 unknown men, on a night fly of approximately 10 hours.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sao Paulo to Miami ,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,SaoPaulo,Miami,94714

Lounges at DXB are massive and though functional have lost the intimate atmosphere that once existed. Food in lounge was fairly predictable too. Flight delayed in DXB 1 hour due to passengers being off loaded but was onboard so managed to relax and watch a movie. Flight was good and service fine. Food much improved for Economy though the snacks in the lounge at rear of plane were a little stale. Chauffeur Drive from MCR worked well.

Other airlines were priced for at least $200. Then I found this secret gem. Yes, it did seem suspicious. The price on their website was $73. We were about to book it. Then I started going through the booking process. A few steps later I found out they are going charge me $35 for a carry-on. Well, that totaled to $108. It was still better than other flights. I went a little further. Then they say that they would charge $10 for checking in and for boarding passes. I ended up booking it up for him. But, guess what? Today was his flight. He printed the tickets and boarding passes yesterday at home. Got to the airport on time today and his flight left 20 minutes in advance of the schedule. He got to Chicago earlier than he was supposed to be. I am just saying that yes maybe Spirit Airlines isn't that great and it might have some negative points. But, I think it still has some hope.

95404,Air Canada,1,"""clueless, uncaring, and unhelpful""",2018-01-19,True," Our flight was cancelled last minute at the gate and were told to go to the customer service desk. However, upon arriving there, we were told to just go retrieve our luggage because the agents would not be able to help us and that we would have to call their customer service line to reschedule our flight. We were then given a card with a phone number to call to book another flight and to also book a hotel at a discount. However, upon calling the phone agent, we were told that because the cancellation was not their fault, they could not provide accommodation, even at a discount. We were also told that there would not be another direct flight out until 2 days later, although upon checking the internet, we saw that there were many other direct flights for the next day, with other airlines. The phone agent then told us that that they could not book us a flight with another airline, and that we would have to go back to the airport and speak to the desk agent. All the agents gave us different information and seemed clueless, uncaring, and unhelpful! Because of this airline's stupidity, we all lost out on a day's pay and had to drive down from Toronto to Newark so that we wouldn't miss out on another day's pay. Upon arriving back home, we found out that a friend also went through a similar experience previously with this airline.

20132,SilkAir,5,"""ride was uncomfortable""",2019-10-23,True,"  Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The boarding time stated was 1.30pm but after accumulating nearly a full plane load of passengers in the queue, a change of gate was announced at 1.50pm. We boarded late, which ended up in a late departure. On board, the seats were acceptable with good recline. However, we were on board with a huge group of Chinese tourists, they reclined seats before take off, get up to go to the toilets whilst the plane is taking off, stood up and got their bags before the plane stopped. Cabin crew tried their best to control the mayhem but simply gave up towards the end of the ride. The ride was uncomfortable and felt dangerous due to safety violations of passengers. Although many things are out of SilkAir’s control, I think it would be good if SilkAir gives proper training to the air stewardesses who make announcements. We can never really understand what they are saying because they either fake an American accent but do it so badly that their words are all jumbled up and unclear.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Singapore,October 2019,3.0,3.0,,4.0,,,2.0,no,KualaLumpur,Singapore,22095
37145,Qatar Airways,9,Qatar Airways customer review,2014-10-01,False,Bangkok to Manchester return via Doha 12th and 19th September. The new Doha airport is of course a great improvement on the old one but some issues still continue: checking into the flight at the gate meant pushing 250 people into a space designed for probably 100 rather an unseemly start - it wasn't possible so many of us had to wait until some had got on the plane. The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find – I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge. Now that Qatar have joined One World I may change to Finnair as their prices and travel times are better than Qatar.

I was put on standby rotation out of Vegas and no seats were available because all flights were supposedly sold out for the day.

Check-in smooth and both Boarding Passes issued simultaneously though on 2 different tickets. In Danang no lounge was offered. In Bangkok their lounge is spacious and a relief. Onboard, special meal offered and delivered to perfection. Other 2 options of hot food available. Soft drinks, hot drinks, and wine and beer offered (only 1 brand of each, though. Courtesy upgraded from seat 20A to 3A on first flight (the seats are the same). FA professional and caring. Food quality so, so, and portions were small. Additional food was available and provided on request. IFE onboard ridiculous, some low-rate hidden camera clips were shown in plenum from ceiling monitors. Transfer and transit smooth. Bus-gating in Bangkok (arrival and departure) was not convenient. But in Danang it was better as we walked straight onto the aircraft. I have had 9 trips with this airline and have now, through their FFP Programme, earned myself a domestic 1-way travel in Thailand.

On my last flight (ET618), instead of the now usual Dreamliner, Ethiopian used an older B767, with a very limited entertainment system, as they only showed African, Asian, Hindi and 4 European movies and no blockbusters or US movies; also, immigration forms were not available, but otherwise, a very pleasant flight.",Boeing 767,Business,Business Class,Abidjan to Bangkok via Addis Ababa,June 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,5.0,yes,Abidjan,BangkokviaAddisAbaba,73723

The flights were comfortable and both take offs from Ercan and Sabiha Gokcen and landings in Sabiha Gokcen and in Stansted went smoothly that my toddler slept through them.

I decided to carry 3 of our 4 bags on. The trip went without a flaw. After 12 days in Greece it was time to head back home to Miami. When we board our return flight from Athens to Toronto with a connection to Miami I decided to check all 4 piece of our luggage. Flight boarded on time and was suppose to leave at 1:15-1:30. Wasn’t cleared to take off until 3pm. At that point I realized we were not making our connecting flight to Miami. After arriving in Toronto the disaster began with this airline. We missed our connection as I expected. When asked for assistance on rebooking was told by multiple Air Canada employees to use the “White Phones” located at gate #15. Upon arriving to gate 15 and waiting in line for over an hour I discovered most (50%) of the phone were not in working order. When I finally got my opportunity to use a working white phone I was on hold for over 2 hours. I had enough and hung up. I then proceeded to Gate 4 international re-bookings where I again waited for over two hours with hundreds of other people to be told they are closing the gate at 12 midnight and will reopen at 4 am. I was then handed a card and told to call this number to rebook your flight. They offered no  hotel vouchers, no food vouchers, no  beverage vouchers. Employees said to find the nearest hotels.  We decided to find the best location to sleep for the night. I figured I would give the phone number in the card a try -after 3 hours and 7 minutes of being on hold I had enough.  I had to book another flight to Montreal to connect to Miami. Instead of arriving in Miami on June 23 (original return flight) we arrive on June 25. I forgot to mention my luggage was lost.

My wife and I had a booking for March 2018 to fly Canberra Australia to Wellington New Zealand, one way. This relates to customer service pre-flight, not comfort or service on a flight. Booking was no problem and great price. Our dates were not flexible due to other commitments. We received notification that our flight was cancelled (by the airline) and we had the option to accept an alternative (suggested flights nominated) or decline. Choosing decline gave a direction to call their help line. Called the number and despite stating our case several times that as there was no suitable alternative we would request refund we kept being offered alternative dates. Finally our request was understood (we were dealing with a human) and we were told that the operator did not have authority to action that request and our request would be forwarded to another area who would get back to us ""soon"". When asked for a timeframe we couldn't be given one. Now, I would expect that as this was the airline making the change, and, knowing that choosing decline would generate calls to the help line, a professional outfit would have provided that option for operators to action. But, no. It took a follow up email and then a second phone call to finally be advised that our request to cancel was actioned. When asked when we could expect a refund in our account we are told up to four weeks!! And, no advice of the amount to be actually refund, we have to wait for it to turn up before we can be sure full refund.

I have purchased first class tickets and have never asked for an upgrade. In 2021 I flew Delta so much that I achieved Platinum Status for 2022. Delta’s Platinum status provides a number of regional upgrades as a reward for flying so much over the course of a year. In July I knew what my travel schedule would be for the remainder of the year so I purchased tickets to travel for September, November and my annual Christmas trip home. I used the certificates to purchase first class seats for my travel dates. Then on the day of my Christmas travel I printed out my first-class tickets and boarding passes for the trip. I reached out to Delta to confirm my seats. At that point I was told that I needed one more pass to have first class seats for my round trip travel. I was told the young lady that I purchased the tickets in June and I have my tickets showing my travel in first class and my seat assignments for the round trip. I was passed along from agent to agent and finally I was told that the agent who booked the trip made a mistake and I would either have to pay $1,100 or 150,000 air miles to use the ticket that I had printed out. I was outraged to say the least. Even though I was told by every agent that I spoke with that it was Delta’s mistake and not mine. Reluctantly, I agreed to their demands and completed my trip however this episode left a really bad taste in my mouth and tarnished my opinion of Delta Airlines. For years I could have been flying US Air and landing in Florence which is closer to my family. However, I remained loyal to Delta because I liked their service.

28365,Spirit Airlines,1,Spirit Airlines customer review,2015-05-11,False,On May 9 2015 I attempted to fly Spirit Airlines flight 332 from Atlantic City to Boston. After 6 hours of delays that were not fully explained the flight was cancelled at 10pm. While I received a full refund the staff were extremely unhelpful and customer service was seriously lacking. A few examples: Gate agents spoke in a rude arrogant manner to any passenger who tried to get more information about the flight. We were told the delay was due to the previous night's weather in the Midwest which did not explain why our 5pm flight from New Jersey was late (and our plane was supposed to be coming from Florida). No food or hotel vouchers were offered even after the flight was canceled and passengers were stranded until the next available flight 48 hours later. At 9pm a gate attendant announced that our plane to Boston had landed and we would board soon and to form a line to board. After 15 minutes without any update (and a gate attendant standing at the desk with her back turned to avoid passenger's questions) I had to ask nearby pilots what was going on. They informed me that the plane had not actually landed but was circling overhead because of fog. 10 minutes later our flight was canceled. I will never fly Spirit again and I hope this review helps other people make the same decision!,,,,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,no,,,31153

43947,Kenya Airways,1,"""Avoid this airline like the plague""",2024-01-20,True,"  This is our first time flying with Kenya airways & will be the last. We are in Africa for a 25th anniversary trip & we were flying (KQ flight 471) from Kigali to Nairobi on 19th Jan 2024. We arrived at the airport at 7 am for the 9.10 am flight. Minutes after take-off, the pilot announced that we were returning to the gate, as a ""door latch wasn't closing"" & they needed to have it looked at. At around 10 am, after half an hour sitting on the flight, they said we needed to get off & they would give us an update. After sitting around for 3 hours, at 1 pm, we were told that we would be put on a flight at 7 pm, and that they were going to bus us to a hotel for lunch & to wait. We had a flight to Zanzibar at 6.30 pm on Jan 19th, but since we weren't even supposed to leave Kigali till 7 pm, we knew we would not make our connection. The Kenya Airways rep assured all of us that all of us would ""automatically"" be booked onto connecting flights & we didn't have to worry about a thing. Since matters were out of our hands at that time, We left with our fellow passengers & were taken to a not so nice hotel, where we were told to have lunch & wait for an update. At around 5 pm, the reception informed us that Kenya Airways had updated them that we were no longer going on the 7 pm flight, but were going to be out on a 3.40 am flight to Nairobi, the next day, January 20th. It would be more 17 hours past our original departure time, but we had no option but to wait it out, as our bags were still at the airport. Somehow, we all made it to 1 am at night, when a bus arrived to take us back to Kigali airport. Upon arrival, we were told that the 3.40 am flight(KQ 479) was delayed till 4.40 am. To make things even more chaotic, our connecting flight to Zanzibar(KQ 490) was also already delayed from 8 am to 11.20 am. I'm writing this as I sit at the airport, hoping to finally get to Zanzibar today. The total flight time from Kigali to Nairobi & Nairobi to Zanzibar is 3 hours or so, and thanks to Kenya Airways, we have already spent 27 hours at the airport & the hotel & we still don't know if we will actually get to Zanzibar today. And if our bags will be on the Zanzibar flight. Time will tell. It's only now that I'm reading all the terrible reviews of Kenya Airways. We experienced the terrible customer service first hand, with agents not having any replies to questions, absolutely no apologies from any staff for the agony caused, and long lines of angry customers at every counter. The horror stories are real. Avoid this airline like the plague, if you value your peace of mind. Anyone can understand one aircraft having ""operational issues"". But from what we saw and experienced, cancellations, delays, no accountability & no apologies are a daily way of life for Kenya Airways. How can an airline get it so wrong, so many times? Bottom line-run as fast as you can from Kenya airways, you will thank yourself that you did.

We finally got to the front of line and were advised frontier had no available flights for an additional five days which would have cost us to lose our jobs. We were told we would be reimbursed for our cancelled flight, hotel stays if needed, as well as a flight through another airline. We tried renting a car to drive home but all rental cars for multiple airports were sold out due to cancelled flights. We called dozens of hotels that were all completely booked again due to cancelled flights. We went to every airline trying to find flights and finally found one through united three days later and then booked a hotel. We would have never incurred any of these purchases if it wasnt for frontiers cancelled flight. We filed out reimbursement per our instructions from frontier to find out they would not reimburse the cancelled flight. They would only refund our flight from United airlines for $300 even though it cost us well over that per passenger. And they would not refund our hotel as the airline did not provide us an authorization letter which we would have asked for if we knew it was a thing we needed. No frontier employee ever advised we would need such a document. I spent well over a combined 20+ hours on hold with multiple customer service representatives and managers who not only gave attitude to our situation but also hung up on me several time despite us trying to be extremely calm.

The seat was at the end of its life too. The entertainment system was an old generation one, with no on demand programs and a small screen. Noise in the cabin was too loud - like on most B777's.

97611,Air France,1,"""checked luggage had been left behind in Paris""",2023-10-02,True,"  Disappointing Business Class Experience on Air France. My wife and I recently flew with Air France in business class from Rabat to Manchester, with a connecting flight in Paris. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience that did not meet our expectations. On September 28, we boarded our flight from Rabat to Paris. The business class seats were barely an upgrade from economy, with limited recline and lacking amenities. The meal service was lacking - a small cold pasta salad and no appetizer or dessert. Upon arriving at CDG, there was no priority boarding or fast track security for business class passengers. We waited in a long queue for 35 minutes to board our connecting flight to Manchester. Again, the business class meal was mediocre - a small cold sandwich. On our return journey on October 1, we decided to fly economy class. Our flight from Manchester departed 15 minutes late. We were anxious about missing our connection in Paris due to the delay. The food was disappointing. Our flight landed in Paris 25 minutes late, giving us under 40 minutes to catch our connection to Rabat. We rushed through the airport and reached the gate just in time. However, upon landing in Rabat, we were informed that our checked luggage had been left behind in Paris. We had to return to the airport at 11:30pm when Air France sent the bags on a later flight. Overall, Air France's subpar seats, lack of amenities, mediocre food, and mismanaged baggage handling made this a terrible experience.

74242,British Airways,5,British Airways customer review,2015-05-31,False,Punta Cana - Gatwick. World Traveller Plus cabin on B777. I find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engines. Seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. The front row of World Traveller Pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. IFE was OK but nothing special. Main meal was OK but breakfast was an absolute disgrace; a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar. No alternatives offered. I know this is not business class but for the premium I paid for World Traveller Plus I feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. The drinks service was nothing special either; one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. Then nothing until breakfast. Regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. When in all innocence I used a toilet in the Business Class cabin I found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when I emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. Fair enough but when I explained that other passengers in World Traveller Plus had also used the toilets in Business Class I was virtually called a liar. I backed off from an argument but I found the experience upsetting and I simply couldn't get to sleep thereafter. I eventually disembarked at LGW hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny. In summary World Traveller Plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and space but don't get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,,3.0,no,,,81644

Seats were as comfortable as any other airline in Economy flight attendants were helpful and friendly (blankets were offered they brought around water and juice had lots of smiles etc.) planes were clean and flights on time. I'll agree that the queuing area in Reykjavik left something to be desired - not much room lots of planes leaving at the same time short on restrooms and water fountains. The in-flight entertainment had a lot of old programming but there was plenty of variety and we enjoyed seeing things we'd missed the first time around anyway.

We landed at 1200 and the flight was planned to leave at 1220. We ran, first off the plane to the gate which was closed. Even though we could see the plane still there. We ran to the transfer desk and were met with some of the worst customer service agents I have ever seen. None of this was our fault. Yet they made us feel that way. We were never apologized to nor did we even receive a smile. They would not call anyone to open the gate for us to make our flight instead begrudgingly gave us a boarding pass to the next available flight which was another 3 hours later. Again. Never received an apology or compensation or a remote amount of sympathy. I Will never fly with this airline again. I'm so disappointed. It has taken me 11 hours to get somewhere that should be a 2 hour flight. And I would feel better if at least one of the service agents had empathy for what we were going through as travellers.

Informed them that Scoot was the one who promised this, and it was their responsibility to get one. I kept repeating myself so many times. It was clear that the person speaking to me on the phone was lacking the understanding language of simple English. Once again, the same incident happened in Melbourne. No wheelchair.

93450,Aeromexico,1,"""run-around when I tried to get a refund""",2021-01-31,True,"  In brief, they cancelled my flight and then gave me the run-around when I tried to get a refund. In July of 2020 I bought a round-trip ticket London-Cancun for a friend for travel in August. Three days later they cancelled their London-Mexico City flights for the entire month of August. I called to find an alternative, but they couldn't offer me anything, save for travel credit. When I said I wanted a refund, the agent said I'd have to write to a dedicated email address. The email was returned as undeliverable, so I opened a dispute through my credit card, figuring I'd get my money back that way. AeroMexico objected to the dispute, saying my fare was non-refundable; they said I had credit to use within a year, minus a $200 no-show fee. A no-show fee for a cancelled flight. When I finally fixed the problem with their email address, they said that since I bought the ticket through a third party vendor (in this case Orbitz) I'd have to get the refund through them. Orbitz was helpful, but said they still had to go through AeroMexico for their approval before issuing a refund. Months went by, and all Orbitz could say was that the airlines are very slow these days and AeroMexico was not responding. So they have the manpower to object to my credit card dispute and keep my money, just not the manpower to approve my refund. I wrote to them several times about this discrepancy, but they never addressed that issue, just repeating I'd have to go through Orbitz. Let me add, I tried to be understanding. I can see that the airlines are strapped. I said I would accept credit in place of a refund if I could change the name of the passenger (which the rules disallow; remember I got this for a friend) and if the credit were not time restricted (which, so far as I can see, just helps them out even more). They said they could not do that because their policies do not allow it. Of course, their policies are under their control. They could change their policy if they wanted to, or just make an exception. ",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Cancun,August 2020,,,,,,,1.0,no,London,Cancun,102713

After finally speaking with two female representatives we were told that there would be no food or hotel accommodations and that the only thing they could offer us was up to a 400 dollar reimbursement if we booked another flight only. No mention of getting a refund on the flight that was cancelled. The next available flight to Cincinnati would be on Tuesday which is two days away.

84158,Allegiant Air,1,"""worst airline in the United States""",2021-07-03,False,"  Allegiant Air is the worst airline in the United States. The have absolutely no care for passengers, even including their boarding, the cleanliness of the aircraft, the extremely tiny vinyl covered seats with very limited legroom, and normally no advance announcements of are the known conditions which delays a flight. Allegiant requires you to pay for any seat choice, and if you do not choose and pay for a seat, they will give you the worst seat to encourage you to pay for a better seat. Last year at the height of covid, on one of my flights there were 17 rows of three seats with no passengers, but in spite of that they chose a seat where the entire row including my sea was full. Talk about not caring about covid transmission, eight months before the first vaccines were available. I have an upcoming flight, and with Hurricane Elsa possibly coming close to impact my home in Fort Lauderdale, so last night July 2, 2021, I wanted to ask about changing my outgoing flight from Syracuse to July 4th, instead of July 8th, and called customer service, and after three hours and thirty minutes, was on hold, with the volume low on speaker, so I could continue to enjoy other activities, and finally just gave up, but proof of their horrible customer service. While on hold, I made three attempts to use the chat service, and each time no agents were available. Lets also not forget that Allegiant has a very substantial background of mechanical failures that delay or cancel flights. Also, many times if you have a computer, with lets say Windows 7, you cannot even book a flight, as their IT people are not intelligent enough to match any other airline in the world, where you can book online.",,Business,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Syracuse,July 2021,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,no,FtLauderdale,Syracuse,92513

In just one hour flight full meal was served including 2 choices in econ which include hot meal bread cheese dessert salad coffee....and it was very delicious.

Almost 40% penalty charges is just too much. We feel like this is taking undue advantage especially at this time of the pandemic. Eva Air should be more compassionate to their customers.

Being that we booked through a travel agent I didn't do my research until after the trip was booked. I must say I was surprised. I was well aware of all the hidden fees. So I wasn't surprised about the bag fees, snack fees, seat fees, boarding pass fees etc. They tell you that you if you don't buy your seat they can't guarantee that you will sit next to your family. But if you are on the same reservation they will seat you with them. It is possible to get all of your clothing into the free bag without having to pay the bag fees. I'm talking up to 6 outfits plus 3 pairs of shoes. Regarding the food. You can take snacks on the plane. My party ate each time before we got on the plane so we were not hungry during the flight.

""why don't you send me an email?"" No responses. Then, they said that my flight was cancelled because of the weather and I said ""you did not cancel a flight from a week ago because of weather"". Responsible airlines resolve their mess by buying you tickets with other airlines. This one even pay me the hotel. But this was even worse: I paid an insurance that Copa offered in their website, which is based in Panama City. That insurance also did not want to pay because of technicalities saying that ""we covered you if the flight was delayed for more than 12 hours, not cancelled"". When I asked ""Does Copa ever delay any flight for more than 12 hours?"", they replied: ""No"". Obviously, this is a way to cheat customers because no flight is delayed for more than 12 hours. Business people: don't fly with this airline, they are irresponsible and will make you pay for everything and be absent of your relatives and next meetings.

You can choose from a number of options during booking, including baggage and meal options - which raises the prices quite a bit. After booking, there was very little spam and hassle. Paris Orly Airport is a bad way to start your holiday. Since we deliberately did not book any food or drink options, we brought plenty of foods and drinks, and consuming those on board was not a problem. We looked at the food that was pre booked and were surprised how small the portions were. Apart from that everything aboard the plane is on sale, you dont get a pillow, blanket or headphone - but we were prepared for that. Crew running through the aisle serving food and drinks was a tad unnerving. Crew was very strict in enforcing rules, i.e one passenger stood up right after landing, and crew immediately told him this next time they would call the police on him. The seat was surprisingly comfortable with lots of leg room, however we saw quite a few seats with gigantic entertainment boxes in the leg room. Entertainment system was free of charge, movie choice seemed rather small for a long haul flight. Internet was available, at a hefty price tag.

After 30 mins the passengers were wandering around the apron area (which was unsafe) while the aircraft was still being prepared (passengers who started their journey in Kigali had a one-and-half hour trust at Entebbe on the plane - that must have been a joy.

The flight Istanbul to London was OK. Food was good, but I just can't work out what the Chef on Board does. They don't cook anything. The airline moves people from A-B - it does not do it with a smile or grace.

Flight from ASM to ADD was on an old B767-300 with overhead compartments not closing properly, and half the seats unfit for air travel (seats that do not recline, no belts). The fact that Ethiopian doesn’t seem to care is beyond understanding but Eritrean aviation authorities should check the aircrafts and ground them if they keep treating customers and safety like this. Transiting through Addis is a nightmare (airport stuck in time, few dining and drinking options, not enough seats within the transit area, smoking area that is disgusting, employees literaly force you to reach your gate even if your flight is in two hours and there is nothing around boarding gates).

I found it strange that a full service airline would even have that option but given the fare was not cheap I assumed service on board would make up for this. Boarding was slow and messy requiring passengers to queue to have their documents checked, then queue again to check our tickets, then queue again in the jet bridge. What is the point of assigning boarding groups when all but priority passengers are called to board at the same time? Seats in economy were akin to a budget airline with minimal legroom, no headrest or entertainment. Cabin was not clean, and crew handed out alcohol wipes. On both legs I took with Lufthansa there was no food or drink available, complimentary or paid. This was a 2 hour service right about lunchtime. Almost any other full service airline would have provided some sort of food service. It is already low cost carrier like to only have paid food services. To have no service at all is just pathetic for a 5 Star Airline. Crew were barely seen during the flight. To top it off the flight was delayed. Overall the flight was worse than ultra low cost carriers while charging more.

As a student studying abroad, I am on a very tight budget. I have very little data while abroad and so I did not know it was required that I check in before hand. I was charged 60 Euro, when the email said “you might be charged a fee”, not might, there was no discussion, no alternative ways presented, and I was forced to pay 60 euro for a piece of paper all because I didn’t read the fine print terms and conditions.  I find that response from the staff extremely sneaky, rude, unempathetic, and honestly quite dumb as I have never once flown on another airline where you can’t check in happily and for free at the airport. I asked them why I was paying 60 dollars and the response was “because you didn’t check in online”. Extremely unimpressed with the staff, quality of flight, and airline logistics in general.

No seating as lounge full to overflowing toilets dirty and two lots of security ate into our very limited time. Back on the bus and our flight to Melbourne. Greeted warmly and seats fantastic and for us that was where it ended. For first time Qatar users we were not informed that to eat we had to request and subsequently very little food actually offered for a 13 hour plus flight. When food was finally requested due to extreme hunger and no chance to eat at Doha we were told there would be a long wait as crew were resting. Very little cabin presence throughout flight.

It first started in Miami where there were 2 or 3 delays for the flight from Miami to Atlanta, there were no announcements regarding why the delays were happening and no information given whatsoever. The weather was a little overcast sky, but that was it. Once we finally boarded the aircraft, we landed in Atlanta 15 minutes after our connected flight had already left. We were not sure what our next steps were, so we went to the Delta Help counter on Concourse A where we encountered a nasty, condescending, rude, disrespectful employee. It was bad enough that we were upset that we missed our flight, but to make matters worse to endure her and her unpleasant attitude. First of all, in Miami there was no reason given why our flight was delayed and then when we got to Atlanta we had to stay in the airport all night and were not compensated or reimbursed for anything, not so much as a blanket, a cup of coffee or water. I understand that things happen but to be treated in the matter of which we were is Unacceptable and definitely not customer-oriented or customer friendly, at all. From the first delay, where there were no updates, to the rude employee, to no compensation for anything, not to mention that my husband and I missed a day of work and missed wages and had to pay an extra day of parking at our original destination where we had parked and pre-paid.

What was different was the connecting service on their short haul Embraer: Where once was a comfortable (and industry standard) 2x1 configuration, there is now 2x2 coach seating with a few inches extra legroom (a recent change, the flight attendant said apologetically, and ""many passengers complain""). Well, this passenger was really disappointed, inconvenienced (you can't work on coach trays) and quite angry: We are used to penny pinching in coach, but densifying premium cabins is pinching one penny too many. It's also misleading advertising: A C cabin with coach seating is not a C cabin and shouldn't be sold as such. I hope the airline will have a rethink before rolling this out across the fleet.

PRG-LHR is on a small business class seat (same as in economy), dried up breakfast that was tasteless, flight attendants that could not care less and when I asked for coffee told me they were landing soon (40 mins before landing) and that I should have thought of it earlier. London to Washington  was on a broken down 747, seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor. Had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat. Food was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sips. Entertainment system has about 40 movies, compared to about 200 options on AA flights. Overall horrible experience. The extra added costs for flying over LHR and paying extra  tax is ridiculous. BA, what is it about your flights PRG-LHR, with your onboard luggage allowance only?

Apart from these advantages of the loyalty program, which have hooked me a lot, what stands out above all is the punctuality of its flights and the good frequency of the flights of interest to me.

We pre-paid for our checked baggage, and arrived at the check-in counter 42 minutes prior to departure. The employee behind the desk informed us that they do not allow checked baggage later than 45 minutes to departure, and that no one was available to bring our bags to the gate. I asked if she could check with the luggage people, she would not. I asked if the other employee at the counter playing on her phone could help, she said they were not going to the gate and could not help. After realizing the lost cause we discarded $80 worth of toiletries to get through security. Upon arriving at the gate, the same employee was there (even though she said she wasn't going to be) and there were 2 luggage employees sitting at the top of the jetway playing on their phones. Apart from the lack of customer service, both the employee and her supervisor were incredibly rude and condescending. In addition the seats were cramped, the drink service was horrible, and they nickel and dime you for everything.

So I was sent by customer service to get my fish from baggage (it was checked) then come back. I did and asked again to change to the plan to layover 12 hours in Anchorage. I went and waited in line again. I got my fish into the freezer in Anchorage for 28$ not bad but I shouldn't have to pay for that. 3 hours in Soldotna 12 hours in Anchorage a red-eye flight to Seattle then another 3 hour lay-over until my next flight home which is only a 2.5 hour drive.

Even then, luggage came out on the belt quickly after cabin doors were opened. In HUI they use bussgate which is a joke and waste of time and resources as the aircraft is always parked only 200 meters away from the Terminal building.

I had to stay overnight in the Oryx Lounge which was crowded. No earplugs nor eye mask available. At least showers were very clean and comfortable.

The proximity of the pantry was no guarantee for a good service, on the contrary. On departure there was a delay of 20 minutes.

Not for the part where we were, we were ignored by the cabin crew. When serving the meal, I was probably the last passenger in the plane to get my pork with cold noodles. For the sake of clarity, because we flew several times with Cathay Pacific, I became a member of the Marco Polo club, silver member now. This loyalty is apparently one-sided because at home I filed a complaint and received an automated message that one of the employees of the Customer Relations Department would contact me within 10 days. This has not yet happened, not even to mention that the complaint handling takes longer, nothing. I think this is a shameful way to deal with your customers.

China Eastern marketed flights. The long haul leg was flown by their daughter company Shanghai Airlines to Budapest. Amazing experience, pure adventure. Bought this ticket some months earlier for the high season to Europe as a huge bargain for 347 USD including 2 x 23 kg of luggage which is welcomed near X-mas. It costed me in addition positioning and depositioning flights to which I volunteered as I needed the extra miles for my elite status. However, I was notified (2 months before travel) by my online travel agent (Travelgenio), that the return flight from Budapest was preponed by 1 hour. Then, I was forced to change as I would not be able to arrive in time for the new departure. I then decided to change plans completely and celebrate New Year in Budapest instead of Vietnam. Thus, I postponed my return travel from Budapest by 3 days. This was done by emails to the Travel Agent (no response) and then phone calls to Ch. Eastern in Brisbane and Shanghai. Eventually, it went smoothly and I was changed to my wish without added costs (apart from changing onward flights beyond Hong Kong with another airline). That even allowed me to do another, cheap detour to Hanoi on my way back to Hue. The homepages of China Eastern and Shanghai are difficult to penetrate and to book or change bookings from. Unless one has a Chinese telephone number. However, 10 days before departure I could access seating and chose freely my favourite seats, even got 1 of 4 legs in exit seat. However, one cannot access the entire booking unless registered with CE’s flyer program in which I am not interested. Apart from that it was a good adventure: a complicated travel where everything could have gone wrong, but all went smooth. Arrived in Hongkong early and was able to check-in 6 hours before departure as the airline have many departures daily. No queues at the check-in and the ground staff were good and answered questions though fearing speaking English. Two BPs issued immediately. Flying HKG-PVG is considered as international flights though it could be considered as domestic. That give the advantage of not leaving transit while leaving HKG and passing PVG. First flight was on an aged A320. Extremely controlled and organised priority boarding at gate where all business and elite flyers were boarding entirely before the remaining passengers. Onboard, newspapers and 10 channels of music were offered (bring own headset). Shared monitors showed some educational movies. Food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits. Drinks were unlimited (water, tea, coffee, beers), but only for 1 hour out of the 2½ hour long flight: during ascend and descend all services were closed down until 40 Minutes after kick-off and again 40 Minutes before landing. That leaves passengers with very limited time of service. FAs were fine. The second flight were by Shanghai Airlines’ Dreamliner. It was a very positive surprise and was faultless. Modern aircraft, good food and service, 2 hot meals offered at dinner and then again at breakfast. Frequent drink rounds. Button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly. Individual IFE on touchscreen monitors was very easy and quick to operate with a good number of Western and English translated movies. Toilets clean. Both flights took off earlier than scheduled.

I was impressed. Also I loved the slogans on their seat backs and they had really nice overnight blankets that were much fluffier than what you usually get on planes. It was a cushy ride which was good since one flight was an overnighter. The only thing that could have been improved would have been more food selection which was very minimal with just a few options although what they did have looked good and they had a great drink selection on board. Of course a larger plane also would have been a plus since it was just three seats on each side. Otherwise I would take Icelandair again from the US to Iceland over another airline any day.

I had bought very expensive plane tickets last year and because of COVID I had to postpone my trip. AA had absolutely no way of working with me on getting my money back. It's obvious they just wanted to make money off of anyone who had planned trips in 2020. AA split my trip into two travel vouchers, which ironically you can't use on the same trip. And the vouchers I received were only good until July 2021.

41,Peach Aviation,1,"""impossible to contact Peach Airlines""",2016-08-01,False,"Tokyo to Sapporo with Peach. Never again. Due to heavy snow in Sapporo the plane had to return back to Tokyo. The passengers were informed that we could transfer at no extra cost to the next available Peach flight. The only problem was that the next available Peach flight to Sapporo was in 3 days which did not fit my travel plans. No other compensation was given. In order to get a refund it was necessary to submit a refund application form on line within 10 days. I tried several times to fill in the form on line but it was rejected each time. I therefore did the following in order to try to solve the problem. - I called Peach Contact Center a number of times Nobody answered the phone - in spite of waiting more than 30 minutes each time. - I tried to find a mail address for Peach Airlines in order to make contact No mail address available - I went in person to Peach Airlines at Narita to get a mail address I could contact They could nor find such an address either. Nor could they contact Peach Contact Center for me. In short - it is impossible to contact Peach Airlines. Reading other customers' reviews I now realise this is a common complaint.

The outbound flight was delayed 4 hours. Initially we had to wait for a couple of hours due to bad weather in LAS. That issue is not the airline's responsibility of course. However after we were told that LAS airport was open again we were delayed by about an hour because staff were not able to match the people on board with their passenger manifest. Cabin crew went through the cabin 3 times counting the number of passengers. A ground staff member went through the plane and checked our ID's one by one. Passengers were getting irritated as the clock ticked. Eventually they figured out that 1) a passenger made it into the plane without turning in a boarding pass and 2) a passenger was now without ID because the ground person checking the ID's left the aircraft with the ID and did not return it to the passenger. / Overall I think it was ""nicely done under the circumstances"" but the ground/gate agent(s) made things harder for the passengers and the cabin crew. The return flight from LAS to SJC was uneventful. The airfare was substantially cheaper than their competition and service was nice once we got airborne.

Pros: Brand new plane with top notch entertainment system including selection of 150 movies. The captain was very attentive to the passengers and communicating regularly, particularly during a long period of moderate turbulence which was scary. He also explained why they left with a small delay related to the late arrival of the previous flight from Tel Aviv. The online booking and check-in system was flawless and very intuitive. Cons: Boarding from a remote stand in Lisbon, but that's not the airline's fault. In-flight staff was efficient but not particularly friendly like in Asian airlines. Food was not great but still edible. The lunch was served immediately after take off and then a light meal was served just before landing. Considering the flight was almost 8 hours, there were more than 6 hours between meals and no drinks or food were served during that period. TAP long haul is not a slam dunk but still a very solid and reliable product to take you from Europe to North America. My favourite feature was the inflight entertainment system. I regretted not getting the Economy Xtra seat, for almost 8 hours it is probably worth it as the standard seat is very cramped and for anyone over 1,80 m it will not be that comfortable.",A321 Neo LR,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Lisbon to Boston,January 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,yes,Lisbon,Bos,3453

First, they're no bags policy on some flights really does put them in the economy airline category. None of their kiosks we're working and there was only two representatives. I was told that I had to check a bag (I had a very small purse) even though it was backpack sized. Then because it was less than an hour before my flight (45 min) they said they couldn't take my bag that they were making me check. I swear that the attendant acted happy about this. I had to book a new flight for my vacation and I will never be flying United again.

Easy process. Reservation office is manned during office hour and calls answered within 5 minutes. Check in and boarding at Heathrow Terminal 2 was smooth without any hassle. T2 was relatively quiet in late evening. EVA Air flight departs from the Satellite at T2 which is a long walk, so don't leave it to last minute. Plane was a 7 or8 year old Boeing 777-300. Nothing fancy but good leg room and clean (but warm) cabin. Amenity kits, bottled water and high quality blanket were provided upon boarding along with a menu. Dinner service started 1 hour into flight. Food was tasty and drinks were available. Not the best wine choice but it's sufficient. Ice cream was provided. Service was efficient although a bit robotic. Toilets were kept clean throughout the flight and the crew walked along with plenty of water and sandwich. Short stopover at BKK then continued to TPE. Disappointed that the flight map wasn't working properly so we had no update where we were. Return flight TPE to BKK was a 4 hour journey. Again service was efficient. Check in at TPE terminal 2 was very slow though. The airport simply couldn't cope. A week later Bangkok to London with the same equipment and service, with much better check in/bag drop experience in BKK airport (I used online check in which was easy). One of the weakness of EVA Air is the dated product and the poor entrainment system compared with SQ or CX. They are buying new Boeing 777 with new interior, wifi and better screen but not sure if the old stock will get renovated. Overall an excellent and safe airline to fly especially if you are going long haul. Great value, good product and efficient service.

They tried their best even if the company didn't provide them enough of tools to make their work excelent. The last issue was getting back my bag. I was in shock when i get my suitcase damaged. I went and reported it right away, I got report and everything was alright. At Tegel Airport I was informed that i have to call company DOLFI that works with Qatar Airways to solve the issue. That's what i did and here i got another suprise! Lady on the phone told me that she can't help me i have to contact airline.  I did as she said, customer service informed me that they don't deal with this kind of cases and i have to contact airport crew. Again nice airport manager send me back to DOLFI. And finally everything ends here after 1 month. The issue of suitcase was solved, however it was such a poor service, staff in DOLFI is not informed about their duties, which cause misunderstanding.

Product is closer to premium economy as is price and evaluation should consider this as noted many otter compare to full service airlines business products. The seat was ok comfortable but any overnight flight will always be hard. Perhaps better quality pillow and blankets would help. Food was good soy glazed chicken with noodles and vegetables. Chicken very tender and noodles more tasty than they looked. Vegetables were overlooked. Standout was cherry tomato and basil soup. What I liked was they took food and drink order before take off so getting drink after seatbelt sign off pretty quick. Crew very friendly especially cabin manager. Nice wine selection.

I am amazed by the total lack of service and could understand their behaviour if they would pay a full refund for any delay, even a 2 minutes one.

66362,Emirates,5,Emirates customer review,2015-03-28,False,I flew business class from New York to Dubai. I was so looking forward to it since I heard that it was in a class by itself. What a disappointment. The crew were well scrubbed in their uniforms and led me to my seat. It consisted of a small cube like area with a nice sized video screen. I soon found out that the space was very constricting. My wife was next to me and a partition between us was lowered but not all the way. There was a 4 inch portion that still protruded that did not allow for comfortable placement of my arm. The lie flat seats were not truly lie flat. By the way this was an A380 and the seats were more 175 degrees. The head area seemed a little bit elevated. There was a cushion-mattress that was given to place over the reclined seat that did make it more comfortable but the confined space of the pod like area was uncomfortable. I could not really move my arms very well around my head. I had flown Air New Zealand a few months ago and their business class on a 777 was far superior. When I arrived on New York on the return the flight was an hour late. Even though my baggage was checked thru to Jetblue when I went through customs and tried to recheck the baggage I was told it was too late for it to be transferred to the Jetblue flight. It was 55 minutes to the flight and they needed an hour at least. The Emirates rep said she could not help me. I thought that she could have provided a porter to take the luggage over to Jetblue with me but I had to do that on my own.

Couple that with delay of our return trip from Orlando on the 21st (again misinforming everyone about the nature of the delay) is again unacceptable. The reality of the delay is that they had two flights scheduled to leave Orlando from the same terminal gate at the same time to different airports and chose to have the flight to Philadelphia (flight 1672) depart on time and delay fight 1776 to Trenton (for their own convenience) and apparently instructed their gate attendant to lie to your customers, again unacceptable.

Etihad didn’t even offer to refund us the cost of our ticket, they gave us a partial refund of $300, which was a little insulting.

Philippine Airlines is one of the most improved airlines apparently, however, their terminal had a lot to be desired. Facilities are totally dated and inadequate for the number of passengers. There are not enough food outlets or toilets and it just saps the energy out of you trying to negotiate the place. It's a very small zoo, to be honest! The saving grace is the terminal transfer bus and free wifi. Prices are quadruple what you'd pay outside. The aircraft I flew on (A321NEO) is very nice, comfortable, spacious with screen back TVs. The flight crew were professional, average and I thought they'd be super friendly and show visibly to passengers that enjoy what they do, the Filipino way. Everything just seemed kind of robotic and lacking a bit of heart and humanity. The food on PAL is disgusting. It seriously needs some attention to detail and flavour.

Really on a trip this length a 5 star airline should have lay flat seats. Also the AVOD was poor with movies only available on a loop viewed on a grainy screen. How can an airline be rated 5 star without on demand video on a reasonable screen?

Honestly we had no issues and I would fly it again. The line was very long to check our bags, but we knew it probably would be and arrived 2 hours and 15 minutes before our departure. It took almost an hour to get through the line to check our bags, but we saw that they would announce flights leaving soon and pull passengers out of line to check their bags so they could make their flights. Which was a nice touch because I feel like a lot of airlines in the US wouldn't do that, and if you miss your flight, ""tough luck, you should've arrived sooner."" The plane was nicer than a lot of Southwest airplanes with plenty of leg room in our row (which was 29). One issue though: I paid for seat assignments when I booked the flight, and for some reason it reassigned our seats prior to check in and split our party of 3 up. Wasn't a huge deal bc I realized it when I went to check us in and was able to pick new seats for us 3 to be together. However, we had seats in the 8th row originally, then it had to be the 29th row.

35733,Qatar Airways,5,"""customer support is very poor""",2021-08-03,True,"  Qatar airways offer on paper great value, sadly for us their customer support is very poor. The reservations system is clumsy and full of frustrating redundancies in terms of data input. You need to re-enter country of residence and nationality at payment time despite having done that already for the booking.  The problems arise when there is a bug and it becomes unavoidable to deal with a human operator. And this is where the nightmare starts. The operators, while usually courteous, are unable to do anything useful. In our case, they kept telling us there was nothing wrong with our corrupt data. In one instance, calling the Swiss desk, my call was broken and they would hang it up as we tried to call back. The Doha call center was easier to talk to, but they could not see, let alone fix the data problems. They made us believe that problems would be fixed at check-in or at the transit desk. Upon reaching the Doha stopover around midnight, we got kicked around from desk to desk (transit, to lounge, to ticketing, to upgrade before you fly. And at every stop,  ""we can't help you here, but no worries, your solution is at the next stop"". Nobody did the right thing when a system error is causing additional cost or reduced opportunity. On our previous trip, we checked-in to the Doha Al-Mourjan lounge with two paid up vouchers of which one was mysteriously not showing in their system. They treated us like suspects of having forged the voucher, it took 45 minutes of misery at 1 AM, with them absolutely refusing to let us take a rest while they investigated the bug, despite us offering them to take a debit on our credit card as a safety.  On the latest flight with them, we spent a night in Doha on a chair in a crowded, noisy hall because of the bug that prevented us for 10 days from booking the lounge which was part of planning this trip.

The SFO lounge is a disgrace no First section a $12 bottle of champagne served and even that was not chilled and hence not available as they had received the shipment only in the morning. Seat 22A is in the 2nd small section of the business class cabin (3 class - no First on this service) and it is not at all private or inviting (and the crew made no attempts to make anyone feel welcome) main boarding is from this cabin so very rushed and feels like an extension of premium economy rather than a premium cabin (on a 5 star airline). No introduction or goodbye from the cabin service director (even on AA they do that) no welcome drink offered no news papers or magazines (sorry none loaded sir). Constant loud noise from the galley and the 2 main closets being opened and closed in this business section. Meal service very mediocre. Wines on the Chilean Promotion not loaded no other alternative. 2 Wines to choose from and the champagne was served across the entire cabin from one bottle (had to wait for it to be transferred back and forth and it was not chilled). Lights dimmed after 3 hrs only to be jarringly switched on full throttle 6 hrs into the flight while one is sleeping for dinner service. We had 8 more hrs to go why does pre-arrival dinner need to be served when all we are trying to do is sleep? Average food and not appetizing in presentation. Crew did dim the lights as I wanted to sleep but in general were not bothered one of the lav doors was always wide open and let out bright lights in the cabin and I stood up to close the door 4 times and the crew did nothing. No coffee water etc offered prior to arrival as galley was closed (1.5 hrs out of HK?). Even the new business class seat layout seems cramped even AA have better spacing (on the exact same seats on their 777-ER) and that is saying something.

94635,Air Canada,4,"""absurd fees for changing the flight""",2022-07-10,True,"  I would like to make a complaint. It's funny how things are! When Air Canada sends us an email from the CEO explaining that we may be facing some delays or even cancellations of some flights, and this email is an early apology, and in this same email they ask us to be understanding. However, when the situation is the opposite, that for some reason we cannot travel on the scheduled date and we call to try to reschedule the flight, Air Canada imposes absurd fees for changing the flight. My wife had surgery on June 24th, at first it was supposed to be a simple surgery and the next day she could leave the hospital. However, after the surgery, my wife had complications and almost lost her life, having to spend 5 days in the ICU, having to receive a blood transfusion, losing more than 7 kg. But luckily the worst is over and now she is recovering at home. We have all the information about the surgery and what happened, and a letter from the doctor asking my wife to postpone her return to Canada. She was supposed to return now on June 24th, the doctor requested something around 30 more days for her to fully recover. Based on this, I called Air Canada's medical office to request a change to her flight, and I was informed that this situation was not a medical situation and that they cannot change the ticket. That I should contact the call center, normally as if it were a normal situation. So, I called and talked to an attendant, he said that I should pay a difference of 800 dollars if I wanted to change the ticket for the given date. My wife's ticket has 3 destinations, Foz do Iguacu to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to Toronto, and Toronto to Ottawa. I asked if it would be possible to change all these trips to just one direct trip from Sao Paulo to Montreal, but I was informed that the fee to make this change would be 1800 dollars.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to Foz do Iguacu,June 2022,,,,,,,2.0,no,Ottawa,FozdoIguacu,104026

The movie selection on the VOD system when it eventually worked was pretty poor - most of the movies were years old ""classics"" and I'd seen them all before. There was no power at the seat for my laptop for the entire flight. The food was mediocre - they seem to fous on quantity over quality there was little choice (a choice of three rice dishes) the food arrived still in its foil. The worst thing about this trip was the worst seat I have ever tried to sleep on (even worse than the concrete Lufthansa J-class seats) combined with poorly timed flights (departs afternoon lands 11pm UK time / 7am China time).

Spirit knew that there was a high probability that the flight would have to be canceled, yet they still had everyone on the flight board the plane anyways, and had us wait for an hour and a half in the seats before telling us that the flight was cancelled. Their reparations were horrible, staff was rude and lied to us, and we had to wait another hour and a half in customer service lines to get refunded. My partner and I were not able to go on our planned weekend trip with family at all. The reason for cancellation was that the bathrooms were broken, and while we were seated they had maintenance frantically trying to fix the bathrooms. Since no one could use the bathrooms while we were waiting for the plane to take off, they had their staff escort patrons on and off the plane to use the bathroom, but wouldn't let anyone buy food, get water or leave. While I was being escorted to the bathrooms, I overheard a Sheriff talking about how there was ""no way this plane would take off tonight"", but whoever was in charge working for Spirit kept arguing with him, clearly trying to evade refunding everyone's flight ... a decision that would cost us all. After having us wait seated on the plane for an hour and a half - which they had passed the time by reassuring us the flight would take off soon, and giving us orders about leaving the plane and using bathrooms - they finally told us the flight was cancelled and to de-board. Everyone got an email with a rescheduled flight - for my partner and I the next flight would be the following night which would not work because our return flight was only a few hours away from our arrival. Since it was so late at night there were not other departing flights for us .. if they had just told us the flight was canceled before having us board we would have made it on another flight and been able to go on our weekend trip. So we In order to get refunded we would have to wait for over an hour in one of Spirit's customer service lines. We asked for compensation for other expenses for having to spend the night at a hotel near the airport or some meal voucher which is customary for airlines refunding canceled flight, but all they offered us was a $50 coupon for a carry-on luggage with Spirit. We declined as we will not be flying with them again. Save yourself a huge risk and do not choose to fly with Spirit.

For non-Chinese, this necessitates obtaining Chinese 6 day visa on arrival (free of charge). As I was travelling to Cambodia, the airline had to check that visa on arrival was available to me. Staff were courteous throughout. Despite Covid 19 free certification required for entry into China, the airlines are not required to check and nobody in Shenzhen customs or immigration checked for this either. Still, it's a big risk not to have this. There is an online Chinese customs/health declaration form that must be completed before arrival in Shenzhen. To be blunt - this is a total nightmare for people in transit, as it asks questions like ""where/with whom are you staying in Shenzhen? What's the address? What's the phone number? Truly Baffling as you must fill these in! Flight to Shenzhen was good. Staff were friendly and helpful. Food good. Beverages were a little limited: soft drinks, wine and beer. More could be obtained on request. IFE In Flight Entertainment in English was a little limited; just about enough for 12 hour flight. The terrible Chinese online health declaration had to be completed again for Shenzhen to Phnom Penh flight. Nightmare. Smaller 737 Aircraft. Snack boxes and beverage. No IFE. Staff again friendly.

15726,United Airlines,1,"""they have no clue what they’re doing""",2022-03-06,True,"  United is the most unorganized airline in existence, the way they handled all of our delays was catastrophic and caused unnecessary stress to many, many travelers. It started as we checked our bags, after receiving our baggage tags, I noticed they all had different names on them and none of them were us! They had no idea they were sending our bags to different locations! How does that happen when they check you in with your id’s! After pointing that out to the rep, she had to redo everything and recall our bags. Once we finally get on the plane, we are notified that a “glitch” in the system had sold too many seats and they were working it out to get a family of 5 on board. This process took over an hour and 20 minutes resulting in the captain leaving the plane to find out what was going on. Because of this delay in leaving, half the plane missed their connecting flights including us and there we’re no other flights available that night. We went to find a United customer rep to see what our options are and guess what? Not a single United employee at any of the counters with tons of stranded travelers! Unbelievable! We finally used the app to book a hotel and went to get our bags and they don’t have them! Now we’re stuck in Houston, no bags and no flights until noon the next day and all because the crew in Midland had us waiting for well over an hour for one family and the result was stranding multiple families, it made zero sense. After staying in Houston at a run down hotel, we made it back to the airport, ready to finally get on our way. We boarded our new plane along with a hundred other travelers. We had all just sat down and got situated when they announced, you guessed it, we’re delayed and everyone needs to deplane and remove all carry one. After deplaning everyone, they then announced we could be leaving in 20 minutes or so, then why did we all just get off? I am typing this as I sit here waiting on the latest catastrophe from this airline if you can call it that to see what to do next with my family. United has failed at every level on this trip, delaying flights for a single family while displacing many, many more, trying to send our bags to other locations under other peoples names and completely boarding planes just to deplane and then board again. I will never, ever fly this airline again, they have no clue what they’re doing and seem to make illogical decisions that negatively affect their passengers without consideration of future events.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Dublin via Newark,March 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Hous,n,17275

76099,China Airlines,3,China Airlines customer review,2014-09-24,False,Flew LAX-TPE-BKK and return. The most important thing to know about CI (as of Sept ’14) is that if you purchase your economy ticket through an online service (like Kayak or Expedia) the airlines policy prohibits you from getting a seat assignment prior to day of departure. Unfortunately online ticket purchasers don't find this out until after they've plunked down big bucks on a non-refundable ticket. This lack of a passengers capability to select a seat in advance (not to mention the lack of transparency) is reason enough for you to take your transpacific business to another carrier. The planes used on the transpacific segments of my trip had a tight economy seating configuration with little legroom. It felt pretty much like flying a domestic carrier in the US. Food general service and in-seat entertainment was on par with other airlines on this route. Flight attendants were pleasant. The one benefit of flying CI is that transfer to connecting flights at Taipei's Taoyuan airport is smooth enough to accommodate fairly tight connections time-wise. (This is not the case in Beijing or even Hong Kong). Unless you get an incredible deal on your ticket and you don't care where you sit on a long flight I'd give CI a pass and book with someone else.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,,3.0,no,,,83693

26705,Spirit Airlines,1,"""Totally ruined my trip""",2018-12-20,False,"  Minneapolis to Ft Myers. I booked a flight to see my family over Christmas, with my two cats, using the same TSA-approved cat carrier I’ve flown with at least 10 times. We’re getting ready to board and an agent suddenly tells me the carrier is “too big” and won’t fit under the seat, and that she was “giving me extra time” to “go somewhere in the airport” and BUY a new carrier. Wouldn’t listen to any evidence that the carrier is TSA-approved and collapses down to fit under seats. I even demonstrated it and told them I had flown THEIR airline many times before, with that carrier, with no difficulty. Supervisor wouldn’t listen. So I wheeled my cats in a wheelchair back and forth from one end of the Lindbergh terminal to another, desperately looking for a pet carrier in the shopping areas, but no luck. The store clerks were incredulous that the gate agents had even suggested that. On top of all this, the agents placed all the blame on me for not “knowing the dimension requirements” and would not acknowledge the carrier adjusts to fit. By that time my cats and I were both upset and the Spirit staff were even then totally unhelpful. The first woman even accused me of trying to “suffocate” my own cats by fitting the carrier under the seat. I’ll say again that I’ve flown with that cat carrier many times without incident. They didn’t care that it was the holiday season and did nothing to help me - all they did was change my flight to one three days later. Luggage was already loaded and “couldn’t be taken off.” What awful customer service - hostile attitudes, ridiculous suggestions.

13600,Turkish Airlines,1,"""they couldn't pay me anything""",2019-01-17,True,"  Kilaminjaro to Chicago via Istanbul. My problems began the day before the flight, I had booked a Turkish Airlines award business class ticket using United Mileageplus miles months earlier, but the day before noticed I couldn't select my seat and part of my flights were missing from the itinerary. I called Turkish Airlines to confirm everything was but for some reason I couldn't select my seat, so to arrive to the airport early. I arrive the next day to the airport 3 hours early in Kiliminjaro airport in Tanzania and it turns out there is a massive problem with my ticket. A Turkish airlines agent later said it was ""it was award ticket and NO REC on your onward boarding pass"""" which I have no idea what it means but the agent was smashing away at the keyboard for hours trying to get me on the flight to the point they had to hold the flight to Istanbul. At the very last minute I was finally I was able to board and the Turkish airlines agent said I shouldn't have any more problems, but once I get to Istanbul I need to get my next boarding pass and that my bag would arrive just fine to Chicago (both of these turned out to be false) Already having a bad day,I was informed that for the duration of the flight I would only receive economy service and meals despite booking a business class ticket. Once I arrived to Istanbul, more problems began as the transfer desks agents were extremely unhelpful just ping ponging me from one desk to the other with no agent willing to print my boarding pass or ticket. As it got closed to boarding time I told a transfer desk agent I'm not leaving until they print me my pass which I paid for and I was bound to miss my flight! In the end a desk agent in Istanbul wrote me ticket by hand 30 minutes before the flight was set to take off and told me to run! This ticket got me past security and it seemed everything was ok until I got to the gate and once again they denied me boarding, while they grabbed my passport and the agents again smashing on a computer keys trying to get me boarded. Then they tried to claim that my ticket was only economy until I showed them the receipt, at this point they were once again, holding the next plane up for me. At the very last second they finally let me board the flight to Chicago. Once arriving to Chicago I was once again greeted with more bad news. My bag had not made it so I asked them to ship the bag to Mexico City (where I live). They said I would need to pick it up at the airport ""the next day."" Well turns out the next day was a whopping 5 days later. When the bag arrived it was completely destroyed. The nightmare doesn't end there. I figured they would be quick to provide compensation over such an incident, especially over an expensive long distance business class ticket but was I wrong. Once I began the process I sent them all relevant details including pictures of my damaged bag, and receipts totalling about $500 for various purchases I had to make for the 5 days I didn't have my bag. Then they said that they couldn't pay me anything for my damaged bag because they needed a ""repair invoice"" when they originally said a financial request will suffice in lieu. At that point I had already thrown my damaged baggage away.

Due to traffic and the airline plowing. You would think they would of plowed ahead of time or at least prepped for snow. So are connecting flight was boarding in 20 minutes as we lay in wait on the runway. We checked Air Canada site and it stated that our connecting flight was delayed 2 hours. So my wife and I believed we had time to make the connecting flight being that we were sitting for our an hour on the runway.

(The connecting flight was on time) As we approached the gate to our flight we were stopped and not allowed to enter US customs because they closed at 9pm. We arrived at the gate at 849pm and had time to walked 50 feet to customs. But not to our knowledge Air Canada already rebooked our flight for the following day for 920pm without advising us. The staff was rude and blamed it on US customs even after we told them we have 11 minutes. Then they advised that we couldn’t go through customs because our check bag was on our previous flight. We explained that they can send the bag at a later date because we have to get home to our kids. Note there are over 25 other people they denied as well. Also, other airlines sent our check bag at a later date of flights were running late. Furthermore, Air Canada did book our hotel rooms but did not state when we had to check out.

My flight from Geneva to Moscow was 1.5 hours late, when I had 1.5 hours transit in Moscow, meaning I landed when my connecting flight was about to take off. I knew about the very short transit, therefore consulted the cabin attendant when I found out that the flight was delayed. To which I was told the connecting flight would wait for me and I would be guided to business class just before landing so that I could get off the flight early, in which case the transit would be smooth, and there will be ground staff assisting me the transit. All points was a total lie! They could have, and I do have experience with other flights that the departure time is delayed by 30 minutes or so for connecting passengers, however no such arrangement was made. Neither did they allow me to go to the front of the plane. Rather, I was moved twice to the rear end of the plane due to families wanting to sit together. On top of this, none of the ground crew were there to help me at all. Because of this, I was forced into staying 24 hours in Moscow in a hotel arranged by Aeroflot. But this is the crazy part. You stay in an airport hotel in a ""special"" floor where there are security guards so you cannot leave the hotel. You cannot even go to the common area of the hotel without a security guard behind your back. Basically, you are treated as a prisoner!

2537,S7 Siberia Airlines,1,"""The flight was really good""",2017-11-21,True,"  Moscow to Mineralnye Vody. It was the first time that I bought simple economy class without any luggage. Previous experience with Russian low-costs was far from successful, but before that I used S7 services a lot, so that made me choose that option. Also regarding the fact, that tickets were the cheapest ones at that moment. The flight was really good. Punctual, with friendly cabin crew and nice green airplane (I like their design and it’s an important factor for me). However, I want to leave some life hacks for that tariff option, that may help future passengers to avoid some undesirable obstacles and enjoy the flight as I did. I’ve seen here some critic about that proposal of S7 and I guess often the reason is, that we’re are not used to such types of flights. First of all, be aware what is included in your ticket and what isn’t. In the case of basic economy class it’ food, beverages and 10 kg of hand luggage. You have to pay for a normal luggage and choosing the place in plane. Important thing - if you bought tickets together, it makes no sense to pay for a place to sit also together. A system will make it automatically, so just save your money. In case of additional luggage - it’s better to purchase it in the internet. It will be cheaper than in the airport. In the airplane there isn’t always a lot of free space for hand luggage, but if you have a problem - just ask the stewardess. They are pretty friendly and always here to help. Also if food portion was small for you - you can always ask for additional one.

No hot towels no drinks no engagement with passengers whatsoever. She brought breakfast and I asked if there was a menu and if there was a choice. She said no to both. This is hot breakfast only. I took my hot breakfast and found that after a mouthful of omelette chicken and potato that it was cold. I said to the purser that if she is serving a hot breakfast then at least she could ensure it was hot. At this point any professional purser would jump into service recovery mode with maybe an apology empathy an alternative. No she said what do you want me to do. I suggested a replacement but she said there was only one meal for each passenger. No offer of more bread croissant fruit. Nothing. The flight is about 5 hours and during that time all that was offered was orange or water and coffee with breakfast. No seconds no further drinks rounds. Iberia's website says on these flights you get hot breakfast and a cold snack. No snack served. The only thing that was cold was the service and my breakfast.

Who knew! This is a brand new 737 with a 2-2 business class configuration. Not flat beds though just recliner business class seats. Which for such a long flight is a bit of an inconvenience especially given the tix price. Love having the cook on board. From Turkish delight which is served to you at the very beginning of the flight to your meals ending with strong Turkish coffee the culinary experience is outstanding. Service was a bit distracted. They forgot the menu. They forgot the toiletry bag. The lights were never really dimmed off on this overnight flight. But ok it happens some times.

I am a 6'3"" disabled and booked my flight with that disclosure. To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward.

It is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline British Airways is no different to other European airlines. As a resident of the Netherlands I hear Dutch people saying exactly the same about KLM, their national airline, and french friends say the same about Air France. The onboard service was efficient and friendly, if a little lacking in charm. The food was more than adequate. The in-flight entertainment was adequate too. I'm not sure if the extra one pays for Economy Plus is really worth it in terms of better food, but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters, then it is worth it. When we landed at Heathrow, a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off.

You get poor meals and even though they have coffee, tea, wine etc on the carts at mealtime they will bypass you and offer you nothing. At check in or between flights they don't give you needed information for flights or connections and don't ask as you will be yelled at or treated very rudely. My wife and I try very hard to be undemanding and polite and were treated with indifference or rudely by airline staff.

Maharba lounge in Dubai is acceptable - nothing to write home about. An old A330-302 is used on the Dubai route and the business class is the old version. The plane is showing it's age but the seats are in fairly good condition nevertheless. There was a slight delay in take-off due to a suspected brake issue that turned out to be a false alarm. The crew were pleasant enough and service was perfunctory. Pre-takeoff drinks were served and the meal service was fairly quick after takeoff. The meal itself was OK but not memorable. As this was a late night flight all passengers soon prepared the seat for sleeping. It was not the most comfortable as there was no bed pad provided - only a duvet/pillow. About an hour before landing the cabin lights were put on and a rather dry cheese roll was distributed along with drinks. Connecting passengers have to pass through a security check in Helsinki so need to have separated liquids in hand luggage. The lounge in Helsinki was quiet at the early hour we visited (7am) but spotlessly clean with self service food and drink selections available (oddly, there were no tea bags). The flight from Helsinki to London was on a new A350. The new business class seats were installed and are very comfortable. No amenity kit or blankets/duvets are provided due to the relatively short duration of this leg. There is a single food service which is breakfast and was all good quality and tasty.

I was forced to buy a second ticket through another airline and have yet to be reimbursed by United. Additionally, United jacked up all their prices after cancelling hundreds of flights ($2k+ for a one-way ticket from DC to Houston) - the very definition of price gouging. My return flight (I had purchased roundtrip) with United was delayed by an hour and a half after I had already gone through TSA security check. After that, we continued to be held outside the gate even longer than expected and were then subjected to sitting on the aircraft for 45 minutes without movement. We were then informed that a part was missing from the plane (maybe you should have figured that out before boarding everyone?) and everyone was forced to deplane. After waiting for 20-30 more minutes, we were informed that a new part would not arrive until 6:30pm, no other planes were available for use, and we were not guaranteed takeoff at 6:30pm if we stuck around.

We know of the fact that we do not require entry visa to AUD meeting transiting requirements. SQ checked our baggage through to SCL on our outgoing flight. However, it was a nightmare on our return journey. We arrived at SCL airport 3 hours ahead prior to flight departure. It was a long queue when we arrived at about 10am. We were attended for check in about 45 minutes before departure. To our astonishment, QF refused to check us due to separate flight booking. Only then we learnt QF does not have baggage agreement with SQ hence they were incapable to check us. The solution was to have ETA to enter SYD, check out from the immigration and re-check in. As time was of the essence we requested the staff to apply ETA at a fee. However, the staff concerned deserted her counter and returned after about 15 minutes later. Worst of all the supervisor was all along sitting on the next counter knew of our predicament. The supervisor in question did not take her initiative to attend to us or exchange roles with her peer to resolve the situation.

I made the mistake of purchasing two round-trip tickets from Orlando to Montréal, hoping for a comfortable flight next to my wife in a two-seat row. Unfortunately, the seats proved to be too small by 2 to 4 inches for most people, and for me, almost six inches. While I am 6 feet 2 inches tall and weigh 280 lbs, I am not excessively large. As soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off, I had to stand for the entire flight until it was back on, as there was no comfort in those seats for either me or my wife. The flight attendants were indifferent to our plight. In particular, one of them kept knocking into my wife whenever she passed by.

The new British Airways lounge at Cape Town is a big improvement on the lounge that used to be shared with Virgin, however it filled up quickly with passengers for the two flights.

Neither of us were addressed by our names at any point during the flight. The dinner service was slow and the food mediocre (cold and dry or overcooked and dry). Ironically, they ran out of the South African white wine. The entertainment system wasn't working for most of the flight. British Airways should provide an iPad alternative in First when that happens. PJs and the flat bed made up with a duvet are good touches, but the flight was too turbulent for uninterrupted sleep.

Fortunately I was in the business lounge so grabbed a can of coke and a couple of rolls but for others they would have no time to purchase anything even if they are happy to pay airport prices. This was a 4 hour flight by the way. I had no idea that BA are now charging for food and drink even for water (they kept that one quiet). I rarely travel with hold luggage so now have to pay extra for the luxury of choosing a half decent seat (they kept that one quiet as well when this policy was introduced last spring). How long before they start charging for airport check in or duplicate documents the same as Ryanair. Will they be selling lottery tickets next? Pay-as-you go toilet? British Airways still refer to themselves as ""the worlds favourite airline"". Based on who`s opinion exactly? See no point in using BA now. They usually come out as one of the most expensive carriers when choosing a route. They have the most ignorant and unhelpful cabin staff out of any other carriers. I fly about 100 times annually through business and try and avoid BA. With this latest money grabbing scam I will change my scheduling to avoid them.

Thursday 5/20/21 my travel agent has been trying to get threw to anyone within Customer service as soon as she does 7 hours later and that's waiting on the call back the phone was disconnected nobody from AA had the curstey to call her back the professionalism was gone once that happened. Moving forward to 5/21/21 at 7:30am let's try again but this time we need management to be involved left a couple of VOICE MAILS and as of now still have not received a call back nor an email. (5/22/2021 1:30am ) still waiting. The disappointment and sadness I feel as a new customer words can't explain. What hurts the most is the poor customer service that could've been corrected once the phone was disconnected. Now that no one has called my agent back makes me feel like my hard earn money and the excitement I wanted to see my husband have has gone Down the drain. The thing about this is I don't want the money back we just needed a voucher so we can rebook Within a couple of weeks. So now instead of my husband enjoying his Birthday he has to watch me sit and worry if anything will happen if we'll receive a call back. My fear is next week comes and AA says oh sorry there's nothing we can do it's to late but we've been trying since Thursday.

Their ticket office offered me a refund or change the booking to the next day. Having no choice to come back home, I had to take the flight the day after. Regarding the check-in, I had issues on both legs. From Bangkok, the check-in is done by Thai Airways staff but they were useless. I arrived 2 hours before at the airport and almost missed my flight because they could not fix the issue. I was traveling with my wife, an infant and a child. I had requested a baby bassinet which was only done on one leg. They had the great idea to put my wife and the infant on the first row and me and my child on a different row at the back of the plane. They couldn't give us seats all together so me and my wife could take care of our baby together. I even talked to the Station Manager in Beijing on the phone but she could not care less. On the way back, it was even more ridiculous. The check-in staff was very rude. The flight was full so they upgraded my wife to premium economy but me, my infant and child in Economy. Despite asking them to downgrade my wife so we could all seat together, they refused. They said they were unable to downgrade my wife nor upgrade the rest of my family so we could all seat together. What kind of airlines would separate a family on long-haul? This happened on both legs, so I assume this happened often. During the flight, the entertainment system was mostly for Chinese as there were very few English movies. As for the food, I would advice anyone to bring some snacks on board. There were only selection of Chinese food which was simply disgusting. It was so bad that I couldn't tell what kind of meat it was.

Online booking got me a good seat in the front - not what I call the second class business class back one compartment same as on the Airbus 340. The 777 is not as new as I expected but much better than the tired old 340s. Seats are a bit complicated to figure out with all the controls. Pitch is excellent with lots of room and I had nobody beside me on both legs. This was good as there are no seat pockets to store books or any items. The 777 is better configured and has a nice AVOD system although the choices were somewhat limited in music and TV shows. On the return leg the system crashed at the half way point and never came back on. The 777 is about one hour faster than the 340 and makes the trip a bit faster which is a bonus. Food was okay and service very good and attentive. My last 340 flight last year the cabin crew disappeared after dinner service but on this flight they were always around.

Our flight to Charlotte landed about ten minutes late, we then had to go through immigration, customs, and security again and make it to our next flight that was in one hour. We got through everything as quickly as we could and then ran to the gate our flight was leaving out of and had missed it by 3 minutes. The workers at that gate directed us to a service desk to help with rerouting our flight. We explained the situation to the service desk and they put us on standby on a flight in the morning and reported that they could not confirm this flight for us because missing the flight was our fault. We asked for a hotel voucher for the night and this was refused for the same reason - that missing our flight was our fault. They refused to do anything else.

76047,China Airlines,8,"""crew are proactive and polite""",2016-04-20,False,"  China Airlines offers exceptionally cheap price on this route, which involves one plane change in their Taipei hub, connection is about an hour which is sufficient. Interior design was nothing outstanding, but was still comfortable. Welcome drinks (2 juices and water) plus hot towel and newspaper delivered with a smile. The quality of dinner they serve is quite good, with 3 choices, Japanese style dinner is excellent, followed by the standard fare like cakes and ice cream. Cabin crew are proactive and polite. AVOD offers a fair choice, not that there's a lot, but sufficient for short to medium haul flights, with noise canceling headset. I find the remote control a bit chunky and awkward to use with the twisted cords. Unfortunately, due to bad weather condition in the first leg, I missed the 2nd leg, the staff gladly arranged a hotel for the night and escorted me wth a car to get back. The way they look after transit passengers are reasonable and helpful. Despite the delay due to weather, I think China Airlines will become more competitive with the whole new image and brand concept. My confidence in them has been earned back.

Once I received the confirmation I noted that my Gold Premier number was not on the booking and called Swiss Airlines to find out why. I was advised it was somehow not on the reservation and they indicated it would be added. When we attempted to check-in online the website was down so we had to wait until hours before the trip. Once it was up I saw that my Gold Premier number was still not listed despite 2 prior attempts. In any case we were assigned poor seats didn't get priority boarding or any of the other perks that are supposed to come with Gold Premier status. When I contacted Swiss after the flight I was advised all the information we relied on in choosing Swiss was incorrect per below. So even though we paid Swiss which issued the tickets and the plane was referred to as a Swiss there are no Star Alliance benefits. As to the Swiss affiliate Edelweiss the plane was hot cramped uncomfortable and all drinks were a charge for this 10-hour flight. This was on the way to and from. To add insult to injury the staff were cold and short even for people from Central Europe and Edelweiss will allow the Economy Plus (Extra) to go empty rather than upgrade anyone with Star Alliance status. Instead they want $200 per person per way. The Economy Plus on our return flight was empty yet they ran out of food (unless you want curry on a 10-hour flight) and we were only 3 rows back from the front of Economy. In short we will never fly Swiss or Edelweiss again. Better bet out of Tampa is to drive to Orlando and take the direct on Lufthansa to Frankfurt.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,,4.0,,2.0,no,,,70321

22391,Southwest Airlines,2,"""canceled our flight with very short notice""",2022-08-08,False,"  I appreciate almost everything about Southwest Airlines: their friendly staff members, their free check bags, and even their customer service agents. But what really brings my review in today is a frustration that really ruined the experience altogether. After an anticipated flight home they texted to report that they had canceled our flight, with very short notice. They then rebooked us for another flight with 7+ hrs of airtime. Traveling with an infant makes that possibility near disaster. When I tried to call and rebook (the customer service gal was very courteous, but there wasn’t much she could do) every other flight was significantly longer in airtime or wasn’t until weeks out (since all the more direct flights had been sold out probably months ago). I would like Southwest to consider how this effects the people of whom they claim to care for. The short notice on cancelation left us no choice but to bite the bullet and pay a more expensive ticket on another airline (since its booking a day before) or waste time that could have been spent with the family we were hoping to see and take the longer more miserable travel route. I’m not sure on the reason for the cancelation but a promise/commitment to provide a service should mean something, especially when you pay for it! It would be nice if they would follow through.

98473,Air France,1,Air France customer review,2015-05-06,False,April 3 SIN-CGK Business Class - Air France has a very convenient eCheck-in option whereby you can elect to check-in automatically 30-hours prior to your flight (i.e. no need to manually do it online or via an app) and your boarding pass is sent to you automatically. I used this service for a SIN to CGK flight and arrived at the airport 90 minutes before departure. As I made my way through Immigration I was told to return to the AF check-in counter as the Immigration officials do not accept eBoarding passes for AF flights. Although this was slightly annoying I went to the AF counter. It looked like AF check-in counters were closing as majority of staff were packed up and only 1 counter was still open with a few pax in line. I asked a member of staff where the business class line was as it was not clear and was told that I can check-in using the kiosk. I did just that and received a boarding pass on thermal paper. I once again made my way to Immigration and this time was told that I could not go through Immigration unless AF has verified my documents. I tried to protest but ended up returning to the AF check-in counter again. All the counters were closed and all staff were gone. This was now 55 minutes before departure. In a panic I asked a member of Changi Airport Information Desk team if they could help me. They kindly tracked down the AF office number but there was no answer. A family had arrived by this time with 2 young children in the same situation as me: holding an eBoarding pass but not able to get through Immigration. One of the Changi Airport staff kindly went through Immigration to the Departure lounge and to the gate to approach the AF staff directly. She reported back over the phone that AF may not be able to let me board. 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure a member of the AF ground staff slowly made their way back to the check-in counter and handed me a 'proper' boarding pass and asked me to run to the gate or miss the flight. As she was checking that my passport was in order she told the family of 4 that they could also run to the gate and try and make the flight but there was no way their luggage would be flying with them that day. Looking back at no point during the check-in process (a) the reminder email to check-in online (b) the online check-in or (c) when using the kiosk to check-in - at no point was there ever a mention that the eBoarding pass or the boarding pass on thermal paper was not enough to check-in for the flight. The member of staff who directed me to the kiosk did not mention this either. I was very lucky that the Changi Airport staff kindly helped me but I feel sorry for the family with 2 young kids who I know was denied boarding even though they - like me - followed all the steps required by AF regarding online check-in. This experience alone has taught me NOT to fly AF from Singapore Airport under any circumstances.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,1.0,4.0,,5.0,,3.0,no,,,108257

The seats were hard and not comfortable, cramped. They don't give any water or meal free.  Don't expect any flight entertainment system there is no screen no USB port nothing at all. So if you don't have a phone with movies or a couple of books, prepare yourself for a very long boring flight in a uncomfortable seat that makes it impossible to get any good rest. Then there was the transit at Singapore airport which was okay. Singapore to Bangkok was delayed by about 1 hour on departure when everybody was sitting on the plane and waiting without information. Because you cannot use your earphones before taking off and landing , as it would endanger your security if you cannot hear what the pilot would have to say, at least was the reply when I questioned their policy. They also have you straighten the seats and there again remove your earphones 15 minutes before landing.  This was a long haul flight followed by another one that was delayed by one hour with aggressive crew members.

79499,Air New Zealand,3,"""felt like second class citizens""",2016-07-13,False,"  To sum my family's experience up with Air New Zealand on our most recent trips with them - we felt like second class citizens. In my opinion, Air New Zealand's standards have really slipped since I flew with them in 2010. We flew Apia to Auckland, then Auckland to Sydney the next day. When I made our bookings 2 months before travelling, I only had a small selection of the worst seats on the aircraft (which I had to pay $40 each leg to choose) as the better seats were reserved for Air New Zealand's richer passengers to choose from. Air New Zealand have brought in a policy of penny pinching now and trying to squeeze every last dollar out of you. You now have to pay for luggage, for a meal and even censored in flight entertainment of any quality - with the crew only offering water to us occasionally, while people around me were served meals and drinks etc that they had pre-purchased. To me, this would be fine on a short flight (1-2 hours) on a budget carrier, but not on flights exceeding 4 hours. I opted to pay $10 for all movies in the end, but was pretty disappointed to find that the film I watched had been heavily censored and there were constant interruptions every time an announcement was made (usually about food, or welcoming platinum members etc) and including annoying messages popping up on the screen during films and games. The check in at Auckland the next day was a disaster. Unless you were a business / premium passenger, you are forced to spend ages trying to use their automated check in machines that are very complicated and frustrating, then have to use another even more complicated machine to drop bags off. In both cases, we needed help from 3 members of staff.  The ground staff were helpful and the cabin crews, although not particularly warm, did their job. Air New Zealand have a fleet of modern aircraft and the 2 Boeing 777 aircraft that we travelled on were clean, tidy and comfortable. At this stage, I will avoid Air New Zealand if travelling to or through New Zealand again.

One thing that needs to be addressing I feel based on both flights & is a dangerous precedent that seems to be on the increase is the continued use of mobiles phones whilst taking off and landing. My first flight from Bahrain to Abu Dhabi on take off had a guy who was still talking on his mobile phone, even after the normal warnings issued by the crew! Then landing you can see folk starting texting and this was so evident on both flights. This is safety violations but as the crew are already in their seats none of them can see what’s going on in the cabin. The use of mobiles on take off & landing must be enforced & not one crew member is doing anything to stop what is becoming an epidemic on the most dangerous part of a flight take off & landing... apart from this observation both crews were attentive and one crew member on The Melbourne flight  from Serbia deserves special mention as she did take great care of me even if I slept most of the flight. Makes a nice change when a crew member makes a great effort & goes above the normal of what’s expected from a crew member. Need more of her type in the skies.

In sum, even though UX is a SkyTeam member, its service is way worse than on Transavia and way worse than on KL or AF. I was on AirEuropa flights for a number of times, mostly on intra-EU flights.

The power never came on during the 10.5 hour flight. We had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments.

Everything in Spirit has to be paid, 3 hour flight, you have to pay for water. Most airlines give it to you for free, considering I spent $300 on a flight and I can’t get a water cup. Along with that, carry on bags are all charged and they are overpriced. I was charged $65 for my carryon today, and I had to accept it or I wouldn’t have been able to board.

Airbus was comfortable with an excellent AVOD system while the Boeing was not as comfortable and the AVOD not up to the standard of the Airbus.

63052,easyJet,3,"""delayed by easyJet""",2018-07-24,True,  Inverness to Luton. Third time in a row spectacularly delayed by easyJet this year. The last two have seemingly been a reflection of the poor resilience built into their schedules which are over complicated by crisscrossing all over Europe. They just cannot bee relied on for domestic U.K. travel. Be extremely worried if you receive an email a few days before your flight if it says that the flight will be operated by easyJet Europe as this seems to mean inevitable delays happen. On this occasion the incoming flight arrived late and so missed its window to then avoid a weather related issue at Luton. EasyJet initially refused to pay out compensation because of the Luton related weather issues - when it was pointed out to them that their own flights landed at Luton around the time mine was due to land and BA had found it possible to depart Inverness later and arrive at Heathrow on time they then blamed more French traffic control and weather systems in Europe. This seems to be an airline that cannot respond to any small issue elsewhere in Europe and then meet its timetable. In future I will either use a more expensive but reliable flat carrier or the train. The train would have been quicker all the way from Inverness to London with these delays and they pay out if just 30 minutes late whoever fault it is.

I bought my seat at the time of booking and the system wouldn’t let me to do the same for my daughters. At the time of online check in, I found out that my daughters were seated 7 rows ahead of me on their own which shocked me. Furthermore, I raised my concerns to the officer at the check-in desk. Her seat allocation was more terrible than the system. She allocated me in the middle seat, 2 year at the aisle and 7 year aisle right across making her to sit with a stranger. I was frightened to hear that bad news and had to escalate the issue to the supervisor. Finally, after 20-25 minutes of waiting, supervisor made me (compulsion) to sit with my daughters 7 seats ahead of my paid chosen seat. At least, it was a big relief for me before boarding. Money paid for my chosen seat was gone into Emirates account and no refund was made until now. More paper work following to claim it and a waste of time, so let Emirates enjoy that undeserved money. Service offered by the airline was below standard when compared to the rest of Middle Eastern Carriers and other standard carriers. Families travelling with kids were of least to no concern by the crew. However, I have to admit that Emirates managed to arrive the destination on time. On the return leg, my luggage is not delivered yet or lost on the way. Another issue to deal with Emirates now. Service had gone from standard to pathetic.

Even though the bus doors were shut the buses didn't move and we were on the tarmac for about 15 minutes. No announcement no apologies. The terminal itself was packed when we got there and clearly did not have enough toilets. While they were not downright filthy they were certainly not the cleanest toilets in any airport anywhere.

We waited more than an hour there with about 10 seats no toilets in a room that could comfortably only hold 25 passengers but is now holding a whole plane load. Many started sitting/sleeping on the floor. When it was time to board the bus a stone faced staff member came down to tell us to queue up. Again no announcement no apologies just do as you're told.

I would imagine even after receiving bailout money from the government, service would still be top priority. The best that the hard working people at gate A12 could offer was hotel accommodations for the night.

This happens frequently to me as I often travel on a different ticket onwards from DXB when transiting. One has to hire a ground handling company DNATA (?) and pay them 90 USD to retag two suitcases forward. Instead, I opted to pass twice not only immigration but also security and train commuting. Had to reclaim my bags and check them in again at landside. Otherwise, everything went perfect. I sleep well on the Boeing 787, prefer the middle seats on 2nd row. FAs pleasurable and I allowed them to change my seat. I bought the tickets a year in advance and could at that time not connect easily to Kigali from Nairobi. Earlier flights are now available, but I opted not to change and killed my 12 hours in Pride Lounge in Nairobi with pleasure and in great comfort. Last flight on Embraer, also faultless. But inflight service poor and food is a joke: a single, cold, unappetizing sandwich. I wonder what they can serve cheaper for economy class. Beers and wine available but hidden not displayed on wagons. Business class was full and people were cramped in 1 x 2 configuration. Headsets were for economy class and only given on request. Luggage delivered at belt as some of the very last ones, more than 35 Minutes after passing immigration. No point of Priority Tags. Delay caused by examination of all bags prior to releasing them!

How is it that easily 75% of the time I am in the 30% of flights that are late? They invariably claim operational reasons are behind the delays. What this often means is that they give the plane that was scheduled for your flight to another flight that was delayed. That way they can get away with giving passengers some bottled water and a bun for your 2-hour delay instead of forking over Rp.400000 to each passenger who would have been delayed for 4 hours on the other flight (as required by Indonesia's Passengers Bill of Rights law). Before serious penalties are incurred, they will then give someone else's airplane to your flight so that they won't have to pay you any money either.

We've flown Norwegian 6 times now but after the experiences both to and from Orlando, we will never book with them again. Firstly, the flight out was delayed by almost 6 hours by the time we took off. At no point were we offered so much as a glass of water by Norwegian staff - it seems that if they announce your gate number and make you sit there for 2.5 hours (on top of the first 3.3), they don't have responsibility for the smallest of courtesies. The plane was not the Boeing 787 when we booked. I understand they are having some issues with these planes but they could not have gone for a more 'budget' option if they tried! The seats were small and cramped for legroom and the in flight entertainment system didn't even turn on. The food was terrible - I don't expect the best meal of my life on a plane but it was horrible even by plane food standards. Again, this has not been our experience on previous flights. On the return journey, they weighed every single item for every passenger. Given that they only had two staff operating the check-in desk, this took an inordinate amount of time! Every case which was overweight had to be repacked by each passenger at the desk too - absolutely ridiculous! The family in front of us had one case weighing 23kg and one weighing 16kg. They were not allowed to 'spread' the weight over the two cases combined and instead had to take items out at the desk. They also weighed all hand luggage and the same rule applied. Fortunately, our cases were not overweight but we did have the same issue where one was heavier than 20kg and had to move some items from one case to another. I have never ever experienced this before and, whilst there may be perfectly valid reasons for this, having two staff operate the check-in desk was simply woefully inadequate.

Business Plus is a waste of money if there is a bus from the terminal to the plane since then one does not receive Priority Boarding. Also there is no Priority Deboarding so if one is in row 16/17 and there are exits front and rear then one is last off the plane and last at Passport Control. To be of value Business Plus passengers should always board first and deplane first.

76326,China Eastern Airlines,1,"""avoid at all costs""",2020-01-14,True,"  Paris to Sydney via Shanghai. An absolute shocker - avoid at all costs. It's hard to know where to start. Two of our daughters recently flew with China Eastern Airlines. The food, particularly the vegetarian options, was very poor at best and the in-flight entertainment very limited. However, the main difficulties occurred whilst transiting through Shanghai. The personal security checks on these 2 young women was very invasive. The information provided during their time in transit was extremely poor, there was a need to re-check in luggage checked through to the destination and to apply for temporary entry permit to move between terminals. After a 6 hour layover, with no contact from officials, one of our daughters was told as she was boarding her connecting flight that there was a problem with one of her bags. In a very intimidating manner she was given the 'choice' to miss her flight so the bag could be searched or to get on the flight and sign a form giving permission to have the bag searched, the offending item removed, and the bag put on the next flight in 3 hours time. I might add at this point that this bag had already cleared security and customs in both Oslo and Paris. The bag was not on the next flight and 12 days later, with too many to count calls and e-mails, we were finally reunited with the bag. Over this time China Eastern did not answer a single phone call (the phone just rang out) and replied to approximately 1 e-mail in 10+, and with limited information provided. Throughout this time they refused to provide the standard 10 character file reference code for the check delayed bag status/file information form. In the end it was calls to Qantas and the baggage handlers in Sydney that resolved the matter. We are yet to hear from China Eastern that the bag has arrived even though we picked it up 2 days ago. Oh, and there was nothing missing from the bag when we ended up getting it - so nothing had been packed that was on a banned list for China. When we finally picked up the bag we were told by the baggage handlers that in their experience we were very 'lucky' as in these sort of circumstances they have found that very rarely is the bag reunited with the passenger...

On the outbound flight we were offered orange or champagne, the return flight was orange juice or water but only half the cabin was served so we didn't get anything. Outbound menu did not correspond with the food on offer and the choice of meal soon became no choice at all as halfway through serving the cabin section of 32 seats they ran out. At least on the return flight they managed two thirds of the cabin section before the options dried up again. There was a number of very disgruntled passengers who wondered what exactly they paid extra for. A minor gripe was the toilet was right through the economy section which I'm sure got on those passengers nerves. Seats were ok but the quality of the media system was poor and the touch screen was unreliable and a number of them didn't work at all so more upset passengers. I gave up on mine and watched movies on my phone, the quality was far superior. I had heard good things about BA however that was flying business/club or first class.

On the 6 hour flight from Johannesburg to Addis the business class seats barely recline meal service takes most of the flight and there is no personal entertainment system which is standard on most economy flights let alone business. Lounge in Addis which should be their flagship is still overcrowded with slow internet and no priority boarding for business passengers. On the plane from Addis to Nairobi my original seat was taken when I boarded. I asked the flight attendant and simply redirected me to another seat even though I was originally seated next to my wife. Very little room for overhead luggage so the stewardess said she would take care of it. I asked her not to put my bags in the back and she agreed. I look behind and she is already halfway down the plane. I hope the Star Alliance designation will eventually force a higher standard.

I am a frequent traveler and a father of four wonderful children. I have been travelling with infant numerous times between Europe and South America (KLM, Brasil) and between Europe and Asia (Scandinavian Airlines, Thai Airways, Lufthansa), and it has never been a problem getting an infant bassinet - until now. When purchasing the tickets, I always follow up by talking with a real human to ensure my request for an infant bassinet is registered in the booking. I then repeat the request upon check-in as soon as it opens (typically a day before departure, depending on destination). KLM has not delivered on our 3 last intercontinental flights, leaving us with an infant on our laps for 14 hour flights. All the while, we can see the seats where infant bassinets can be utilized are occupied with passengers not travelling with infants. Children grow quickly, and I doubt we will have more children. As such, this is a temporary problem for us. Regardless, I think it is really poor service level by KLM not to make an effort to facilitate infant bassinet requests better than what they have demonstrated on our last 3 intercontinental flights.",Boeing 777-200ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Stavanger via Amsterdam,November 2022,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,KualaLumpur,StavangerviaAmsterdam,48904

The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly.

85102,Allegiant Air,10,Allegiant Air customer review,2015-05-05,False,We flew round-trip Grand Rapids to Orlando. Never again. We knew prior to booking that we would need to pack light because of the baggage policy. We packed together (my husband and I) and checked one bag. We downloaded the app to our phones so we didn't have to pay for the boarding passes. We checked in and paid for luggage before hand to avoid any extra fee for that too. What we didn't expect was to purposely have our seats separated since we did not 'purchase' seats beforehand. You would think that when a husband and wife book 2 plane tickets together at the same time that they would put these two seats together. Big parties sure I can understand why they couldn't all be seated together but two people? Come on. Leaving Grand Rapids the man at the counter rolled his eyes and muttered the seats numbers and letters and that was it. Changed our seats to be together since there was room on the plane which is only fair. The lady at the Orlando ticket counter was a completely different story. She was rude and disrespectful. She insisted that there was no reason we should have to sit together if we didn't have children with us laughed when I told her she was being rude and refused to change our seats even though there was room on the plane to do so. She kept saying this was the policy and no seats were to be given for free. We paid for 2 seats on a plane we didn't want any specific seats we just merely wanted to sit together since we were going on a kid-less vacation and wanted to enjoy our time together. If there are 2 seats together that are open why couldn't we move to them without being charged? The nickel and diming for the baggage fine I get it. Purposely putting 2 passengers separate because you want more money out of them even when there is vacant seats? Distasteful. The flight attendants were less than helpful didn't look too thrilled to be working here either.

The slightly friendly cabin crew were among the least competent cabin staff I have ever seen on a flight. There were people still standing when the flight took off and no crew to be found. The crew tells passengers to close the overhead bins and finally the crew left the cabin lights on for several hours into into the flight and probably would have left them on the whole flight if I had not asked them to turn them off.

At 8:30, we all lined up to board and then after standing for 30 minutes with no direction, we were told that the plane had a mechanical issue. For the following three hours, we were given vague and unhelpful updates roughly once an hour. This was stressful since it was getting later and later in the night. Finally, close to 11:30, we were told the flight was cancelled in Spanish. The message was not repeated in English for another three minutes. We then proceeded down to baggage claim and there was no one from Iberia to direct us or tell us what was happening. We waited in complete confusion for close to 30 minutes. Finally, we were let through a door and told to write our name, phone number and email on a white sheet of printer paper and that they would be getting buses to take us to a hotel. Everyone on our flight was very confused why we were being asked to write our information down as we assumed that any airline would already have this information in their system. At this point, we took a cab and returned to our apartment in Brooklyn to attempt to get some sleep. We were told we would get a phone call or text letting us know when the plane was fixed. At 2:53AM, we woke up to the sound of a text saying our itinerary was changed. We were now scheduled to leave on December 28th at 18:59 to London, have a three-hour layover and then take another flight from London to Madrid. I immediately called Iberia and spoke to an incredibly rude customer service rep. She told me that Iberia already changed my ticket for free so any other change would require a fee. I have never heard of a policy like this. I knew there was a 5:00 (17:00) direct flight on Dec 28th and I at the very least I wanted to get on that. After a very frustrating conversation with no apology or resolution, I attempted to get more sleep. At 7:05AM, I got another text saying that our original flight was delayed to 15:30 and to call the airport at 12:30 to check. I immediately called Iberia to ask about that flight status and why our itinerary didn’t show that flight and the customer service representative could not explain this. They said that the 15:30 flight did not exist and/or that we didn’t have tickets on it. At this point, we were confused whether we should go back to JFK with no ticket or go for our new flight with the connection. I finally reached a customer service rep,  who told us there was nothing he could do. At that point, I asked to speak to his manager and suddenly he said that he could get us on the 17:00 direct flight. I’m confused why this wasn’t an option from the beginning. When we arrived at the airport and returned to our original gate from the previous night around 3:45PM, we were told that our original flight from Thursday night departed at 3:30 (15:30). I do not understand why we weren’t given the option to be on that flight. The lack of clear communication is unacceptable. I have submitted a formal complaint to Iberia about the situation, asking for reimbursement for the cabs and hotel room we had to pay for, but did not use in Spain, and I was sent a generic apology email saying it was out of their control.

Switzerland and Croatia are both within Schengen so there are no immigration issues, it was just the flight deck not wanting to deal with stuff and wanting to take the easy way out.

Turkish Airlines representative at the airport in Venice barely spoke English. The layover in Turkey was 1 hour 5 minutes. Knowing that the 1st flight will be delayed more than 30 minutes they issued boarding passes. After going through the border security I realized that the total delay time was exceeding 40 minutes.

The check-in staff at Fuerteventura airport were very professional and friendly too. Boarding was something of a mishap as there was no reinforcement of the priority boarding. This caused an upheaval as several passengers, rightly voiced their grievances over this. This was a very full flight including several family groups. The cabin crew were far more professional than on my outbound flight and imposed a strict no nuts regime as a passenger had a nut allergy. One crew member stood out from her peers, who was not only very professional but seemed to go the extra mile to assist an elderly couple and to help a lady who was unwell. This crew member is a great credit to Ryanair and deserves recognition for her professionalism and common sense. During the flight 2 to-buys drinks and snacks rounds were performed and again the crew did very well indeed. Although there was a delay of circa 50 minutes to departure this was communicated very well to the passengers. Disembarkation was quite something as a problem passengers stood up before landing and ignored instructions to sit down.

Space around the seat is quite tight, (even in economy comfort) and when the person in front puts their seat back, their head is almost in your lap, can be difficult to eat your meal, while brushing away the person's hair in front of you. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. Our main problem was with a very short connection in Amsterdam, and there was not enough time to transfer into the schengen area. However after we got through passport control and with 5 minutes until our plane left, the gate was closed, so we headed straight to a transfer desk.

The changes introduced in the planes and service to lower the cost have not reflected a decrease in ticket prices but have had a huge impact on the comfort of traveling, especially on international trips. The most worrying thing is the aspect of food or drinks on planes. Even on the lowest-cost airlines, they offer packets of peanuts or some snacks, and constantly water. In Avianca it is terrible that you have to pay for water or move out of your chair to serve yourself to the bottom of the aircraft. Now, the seats are terribly uncomfortable, there is no way to endure a trip of more than 2 hours sitting, not only because they do not recline but because there is no space to accommodate your legs. Now imagine yourself in a window seat, moving all your companions to go back to the plane to ask for water!

The main flight from Tokyo to Cairo was not bad at all. Again I had the seat next to me free which is always good.

This time because I had a $75 voucher from a previously cancelled Frontier flight from November, that left me stranded overnight, sleeping on airport floors while trying to get home to a dying family member. I couldn’t hold back the tears for my beloved family member whose time had come and had to publicly grieve my way through the experience in the airport thanks to Frontier and their cancellations and delays, plane mechanical problems, and whatever excuses they use. Staff are never helpful - they have to deal with these issues continuously and probably hate their jobs. I can’t blame them working for such a chaotic uncaring company. As I sit here and hear all the good airlines (United, Delta, American) calling “last boarding call” and couriering away their happy customers on time, I’m once again jealous and disappointed as I wait and wait. And wait..... almost an hour delay now. No new announcements about the delay. The suspense is building. Will we actually get on a plane to our destination tonight or will it be tomorrow?

Our flight home wasn't scheduled to depart until 10:30pm, but instead was delayed several times and ultimately canceled because of a potential thunderstorm. We were stranded at the airport with no transportation, and ended up staying in a filthy hotel just to have a place to sleep for the night. Our flight was rescheduled at American Airline's earliest convenience, which wasn't until FRIDAY. They would not offer any accommodations for us if we ended up staying. We ended up paying close to $3000 for a flight from Charlotte to Cleveland, and rented a car to get home. Altogether with the hotel, flight, food, and car rental we paid close to $3600 just to get home. I'm very disappointed in American Airlines and the way they are handling this situation.

67496,Etihad Airways,1,"""recommend never flying with Etihad""",2023-01-09,True,"  I recently flew to Abu Dhabi to compete in the World Triathlon Finals with my $7000 triathlon bicycle and gear in a separate bike box. Etihad lost my bicycle box in two airports: Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi. My bike & gear arrived 5 days late so I couldn't use it for the race. This ruined my opportunity to successfully compete for Team Canada at the World Triathlon Championships that I qualified and trained years for. This was devastating for me, as it would be for any athlete. I had to go to the airport in Abu Dhabi to find my bike box - I wasn't given any notification from Etihad staff that it was on the plane or that it had arrived. Etihad staff walked me all around the airport, bringing me to random corners to ask if different boxes looked like my bike. Anyone could have walked out with my bike if they had left it in the hallways they showed me. When I filed a complaint, Etihad offered me $50 US for the inconvenience, but their webpage was broken so I couldn't get the money. When I emailed their staff for help to receive the funds, their baggage assistance staff closed my customer complaint account! So I received no compensation for the delayed bike box and the huge stress this caused me. Secondly, the Etihad staff at the Frankfurt gate at first told me I missed my flight even though the plane was sitting there. They finally let me on after 20min of talking amongst themselves. When I walked on to the plane, someone was in my seat. I stood in the plane for about 15min while Etihad staff unsuccessfully addressed the man in my seat who wouldn't budge. So I had to sit in his seat in order to sit somewhere. I would highly recommend never flying with Etihad - the incompetence and unhelpfulness of the baggage, airport, airline, and customer complaint staff was absolutely astounding.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,Frankfurt,AbuDhabi,74204

The seats can be fully reclined for sleeping. The FAs were attentive. Most surprisingly the food was quite good, which can not be said of their domestic flights where I was given rather dried-up sandwiches with a filling of uncertain provenance. Of course, no alcohol is served. Now the negatives. The IFE is limited. What they call international movies all come out of Hollywood.

The food was the usual minuscule portion but there is an impressive selection of things that you can buy on board for reasonable prices. Unfortunately, most things were ""out of stock"" as the phrase goes in Malaysia as they had run out on the flight over from KL.

This turned into a 6 hour delay and eventually an 8 hour delay (we were initially suppose to leave at 1:40am and took off at 10am). As there we no Hainan Airlines ground staff at the airport until 6am I had to call China to get updates. When ground staff turned up at the gate at 6am they gave us a small snack box as compensation. At Beijing Airport we were told we had missed our connection and told to go and collect our luggage with little guidance from the ground staff. We asked Hainan to be put us on another airline but we told that was not possible and we would have to wait 24 hours until our next flight (we missed our connection by 30 minutes and they didn't hold the flight). I  asked if I could push my return trip back by one day but I was told that this was not possible. The Beijing Airport hotel we were put up in was in poor condition (my hotel room has a wall covered in mold) and the food at the hotel was inedible.

42100,Jetblue Airways,1,"""missing my connection""",2017-08-05,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Boston. Traveling back from Florida with my wife and two young daughters Jetblue sent me an email at 7:47am, 3 hours before my flight 2020 FLL-Worcester was scheduled to take off at 11:06am, that our flight was canceled. Agents on the phone were no help, only offering a flight leaving at 9:25am as an option. They claimed the flight was canceled for mechanical issues; somehow I don't believe that and this was some sort of cost saving cancellation. We rushed to the airport for the 9:25am flight only to be met by bumbling ticket agents who couldn't process customers quick enough. When it was out turn we were locked out. After running in-between terminals we were re-booked on Flight 376 to Philadelphia with a connection to Boston (yes, not our original destination). Flight 376 which was scheduled to depart at 1:32pm was a fiasco from the start. The flight boarded all passengers only to tell us that we'd be delayed as the flight had no water so they needed to wait for hand sanitizer - this wait was over 40 minutes. Stormy weather blew in, the runway was closed and we missed the window. After several openings and closings of the runway we finally took off at 3:30pm - 2 hours after our scheduled departure. The late takeoff meant we would cut it very close for our connecting flight 660 out of Philadelphia for Boston. I received a notification on my phone that the flight had been delayed till 6pm. With our estimated arrival in Philadelphia of 5:45pm I was hoping we'd be able to just make it. I asked the stewardess to speak with the captain as there were around 15 of us that had our Worcester flight 2020 canceled and were rebooked on these flights. I dreaded the thought of missing my connection because of the plane's lack of water and need for a hand-sanitizer delivery that took 40 minutes. The stewardess returned and said she spoke with the captain who would try to hold the flight. About 10 minutes before our landing another stewardess went on the intercom and told all theBoston bound passengers to relax because our gate was right next to Boston flight 660's E2, and that the plane would wait for us as the captain had called ahead. That was a major relief to hear that news. She also explained that we'd be let off the plane first ahead of other passengers to expedite our plane change. This was also a relief to hear considering my carry-ons and precious kid cargo. I nearly texted my father to pick us up at Logan (he was driving from N. Grafton in Worcester county), but I hesitated, wanting to be 100% sure. Well, unfortunately my apprehension proved deserved. When the door to the plane opened there wasn't any parting of the seas to let us through. In fact, both stewardesses who communicated with us disappeared, presumably shying away from the hidden truth. I yelled aloud whether we were being let off first but no one replied. I then looked out the plane's window - there wasn't any plane at E2 - flight 660 had already taken off! I walked down the gate corridor completely bewildered; the crew members were still nowhere to be seen. Upon exiting the gate, the JetBlue ticket agent handed me a new set of tickets. I asked where flight 660 went? The agent replied that it had taken off at 5:47, 13 minutes ahead of schedule and that we were now rebooked on the 8:41pm flight 760. Needless to say, all Boston bound passengers were furious - not sure if I can fly Jetblue for a while!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Boston,August 2017,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,no,FtLauderdale,Bos,46250

I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.

The attendants service and food and beverages quality are the highest standards I have ever experienced in the industry. For me, Qatar Airways is definitely the best airline for Business Class.

I wanted to take a minute to say thank you and share with you why you have converted me from another airline for life. My wife’s Grandmother was in her last days and hours of her life, the last week of March this year. My wife and I had planned on traveling to see her and had a ticket purchased already for my wife and one of my daughters, but we needed it changed and needed to get me and my other daughter a flight. For my work, I travel quite frequently from Nashville to Dallas among other places on another airline. Because of my status I like them to continue to build points with them. I called them first to book myself and my daughter a flight to Phoenix. They were of no assistance, would not budge on the price for an emergency, and would still charge me a large amount to move my points. I hung up. My wife then called Southwest. Not only did they get us booked last minute, they adjusted the pricing for an emergency, and helped us the whole way thru it moving our points around etc.. Even when we got to the airport, they bumped us to an even earlier flight to get us there as quickly as possible. What a blessing it was to fly with you. If we would have gone with the other airline, or had we not been bumped up to an earlier flight, we would not have made it in time to see her grandmother before she passed. We arrived within less than 2 hours of her passing. What you do for people every day may seem routine, but for us, it was a life changing moment. Having my wife be there before her grandmother passed means more to me than I can possibly express to you. As a result, I have decided to switch to Southwest for all of my work and personal trips going forward even though I do not have status with you. Sometimes I fly out of Knoxville where you do not service, but other than that, I will forever use you now.

I had no choice to get on that never ending like. After waiting for almost 2 hrs I finally managed to get to an agent, who was super stressed. She said I should have checked online, so she charged me USD55 per person for checking in at the airport agent.  Tried to explain that I tried countless times, even showed her screenshots.

We traveled to Beijing from Houston late October with tickets bought in May. Our return to Houston was scheduled for October. We arrived at the airport to be told the flight was canceled due to aircraft problems to be told the following day that was a lie. Apparently, for financial reasons Air China canceled both Friday and Sunday flights months ago but didn’t tell everybody. Now changing a very long, costly international flight is already a very poor customer service, but not making absolutely sure everyone realizes such a major change has happened is the worst I have ever seen in an airline. To make matters worse we had to fight to get a hotel and were sent to a very very poor, dirty one. Food was promised to be included but we got there only the buffet consisting of cold chicken nuggets and old eggs were included. Real food had to be paid. When every airline would be trying to make it up, since it was not my fault the flight was changed, getting a nice hotel and food, and an upgrade, Air China simply got us even worse service.

98548,Air France,4,Air France customer review,2014-09-06,False,I flew Air France with six different legs of a European trip in August. Each time we flew into CDG. Fabulous employees. But not one departure left on time. Departures varied from 20 minutes delayed to over an hour. Missed one connection due to this and twice my daughter's wheelchair was lost and finally located again but we were always last leaving plane. Our luggage was lost for one and a half days on our first leg of trip (CDG to Manchester UK) because the flight left Boston so late we were connected to a smaller regional aircraft due to arriving late in CDG thus missing the scheduled Air France flight. In Boston we were told to get our boarding passes for the flight to UK in Paris. In Paris they asked for our boarding passes and it took over an hour to resolve that we were told to get them in Paris and that was the first leg of our disappointing trip. Again wonderful staff but it seems one airport location does not communicate well to another location which then uses up a lot of time at help desks at each airport trying to resolve the issues. The only time our delay was acknowledged was on our last leg of trip back to Boston - this left 20 minutes late which wasn't too bad but we sat on tarmac in Boston without much information for over an hour. The next day we got an e-mail from Air France apologizing for that. But the other five legs of the trip also were with problems.

At that time Kuwait government banned Chinese citizens from entering Kuwait due to corona-virus pandemic, which i totally understand. But Kuwait government did not mention anything regarding transit passenger. Besides, I hadn't travelled to China since August 2019, and I had been living in Bahrain since the pandemic began.  When the airline refused my trip they mentioned it was a rule from the Kuwait government and they could not provide another trip with another airline to me. So I was abandoned by them, stranded in Bangkok with nowhere to go for a night, and had to buy another ticket to return to Bahrain. Since then I tried to request a refund and an apology, but they only replied once to my email saying the ticket can be rebooked with normal rebooking policy and charges may apply.

I have never been more frustrated in my life dealing with anything, as I have trying to get a fair customer outcome with Scoot. I had booked two seats with extra legroom for my wife and I, as we had a young infant flying with us and needed extra room. Without notice, they had changed the aircraft we were flying on, and the seats I had chosen were not extra legroom seats any more, they were just ordinary seats.  There were more spacious seats available, but the crew insisted we had to pay to change to them. Anyway, that was not the frustrating part. Ever tried to get a refund from Scoot? I will tell you it is probably impossible. You would think it is straight forward: I paid for extra leg room seats -> they did not give me extra leg room seats -> therefore I should get a refund? Not so simple. I had paid $158 for the extra leg room seats, they told me they cannot refund me the whole amount as I had selected seats during the booking process so they had to charge me a seat selection fee (something like $20). I proceeded to tell them that the only reason I selected the seats were because I wanted extra space as we had an infant with us, not because I liked 11D and 11E. ""Sorry sir, it is our policy"", but they cannot actually point to this policy in any of their policy disclosure documents. No one I spoke with seemed to understand the basic concept that if I pay for a service and do not receive what I paid for, I should get a refund. They said they will escalate it and call me back. Three months had passed, no call. I call them back, have to re-explain myself, and they said they will escalate and call me back. This went on for a year (can you believe that). I have called again today, and concede just to refund me whatever they saw fit, guess what? They are escalating and calling me back soon. Oh and another thing, Scoot will never give you a cash refund, only in Scoot vouchers. Why would I fly scoot every again after an experience like this? This is the hardest I have ever worked for $158 of vouchers.  I guess that is what you expect from a budget airline.

We got according to new tickets, that we had to stay in Dubai almost 3 days for connecting flight!!!! And I discovered it by chance! When I called to agent to fix this problem, she told me that I have to pay $1,000 extra because they do not have same class tickets, while it was not my choice to change travel dates. I had to go in person to ticketing agent to solve the problem with return tickets dates to be able to come back to work in time after vocation.  The ticketing agent said, that to be able to return on that date I will have to stay in Dubai 25 hours while on initial reservation it was 17 hours. I asked about a complimentary hotel and she tried but failed to book it in the system , and offered to do it later. On my way back to the USA in Dubai Emirates desk refused to give us free hotel and we had to spend 25 hours sitting in the airport.

On this particular flight the disappointments just kept adding up. From the poor service provided by flight attendants who were more interested in chatting in the galley to the very poor quality meal and drink selection. For the price they are charging for a business class ticket one would think they could provide some decent wines and video entertainment. Seats are not flatbed and were not long enough for my 180 cm frame. The business class lounge was very poor although not operated by Thai they should not be using 3rd party operators that provide poor food and drink selection and no in site rest rooms. What continues to amaze me is how 2 of the top airlines are operating only a few hours from Bangkok and yet Thai Airways cannot seem to emulate them in the least - how hard is it to go and study what Singapore Airlines or Cathay are doing?,,Business,Business Class,Manila to Bangkok,June 2015,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no,Manila,Bangkok,12486

80473,Air Transat,4,Air Transat customer review,2014-04-29,False,I purchased Option Plus for a return flight Toronto-Manchester. Outbound leg on April 6th provided excellent check in and also cabin service. Onboard our meal order was taken ahead of the economy passengers and also served earlier which provided a nice hot meal. Unfortunately the return flight on April 14th provided abysmal service right from check in. Even though we were travelling Option Plus red priority tags were not put on our bags by the young lady checking us in and when I pointed this out she told me they will be attached before they go on the aircraft and I should just trust her. Obviously I knew this to be untrue as I have used Transat many times in the past and of course I had to wait 40 minutes in Toronto for my bags. We left Manchester at 9.15 am and lunch service did not start until 2.30pm which is far too late and on this newly configured aircraft (2x4x2) the cabin crew served the meals from the front rows to the back rows which takes far to long if you are seated in the back and you end up with a cold meal. Option Plus passengers were not served in advance as we were on the outbound flight and when I pointed this out I was told I was mistaken. Basically Option Plus is not worth the extra money as the priority boarding and priority services you are supposed are often not delivered. The service is always more miss than hit and seemingly more so with the Montreal based cabin crews. Air Canada Rouge is starting to fly this same route so next month I'll probably give them a try instead.

51751,flydubai,3,"""worst flight I have ever been on""",2022-08-18,True,"  I booked a ticket from an airline from Muscat to Batumi round ticket.  My original flight from Dubai to Muscat was canceled, and I was forced to have 11 hours to transit which, if I had known from the start, I would have picked another option to fly. This caused me to rent a room outside the airport to sleep before my morning flight.  My flight from Batumi to Dubai was delayed 4 hours, and no compensation or apologies was offered.  At 5 am, 2 hours before my flight from Dubai to Muscat, I received a message that the flight would have a further delay from 7 am till 14:45. No apparent reason why, although there were no more sandstorms, and all flights were operating just fine. Someone decided this flight could delay, and other fights could go on. This delay caused me to miss another flight from Muscat to Salalah scheduled at 11:40 am with Salam Air which was not refundable.  At the airport, I was trying to find ways to leave before 14:45, so I could meet my commitment in Salalah before 17:00. I checked if I could be offloaded from the flight so I could take my bags and leave on a flight with Oman air at 11:00 am. At first, they told me I could, and I went and purchased the flight from Oman air and another flight from Oman air from Muscat to Salalah at 16:30. I asked them to offload me and directed me to the arrival area to collect my bag. I went there and discovered that it was impossible because I could only collect my bag after the flight takeoff after 14:45. This means that both flights I purchased are now useless. I spoke to the people at the airport, and they only advised me to wait for the flight; otherwise, I would lose my bag. 5. I waited for my flight at 14:45. I have been in transit at the airport for 19 hours with no apparent reasons and no clarification. They started to board people at the gate at 14:20. Here, I realize another delay is happening. The flight only took off at 15:35, which again caused me to miss my flight from Muscat to Salalah at 16:30.

Eventually reset by repeated switches out of the video system. Selection of films etc was OK but not comparable to Emirates product. One criticism is that the IFE was switched off 40 minutes before landing on the Singapore leg (A380). On the return trip it was switched off 20 minutes before landing. Seems ungenerous and not my experience on other airlines. A FA on the Melbourne flight also asked me to remove my noise-cancelling headphones for landing - also a new experience! Online check-in was difficult because of website problems but managed it in the end and subsequent check-in at Melbourne was very quick.

To begin with, the aircraft on both journeys appeared to be in a state of disrepair. The seats were worn out, uncomfortable, and lacked proper cushioning. The tray tables were broken in several instances, making it difficult to utilize them for any purpose. The in-flight entertainment system, or lack thereof, was another major issue. On both flights, the screens were either malfunctioning or next to non-existent. My family was left with no entertainment options during the entire duration of the journey, which was particularly disheartening considering the long hours spent onboard. Moreover, the meal service on these flights was subpar. The food quality was far from satisfactory, with unappetizing taste and limited options. As a vegetarian, I found the lack of suitable choices even more disappointing.

Broken magazine pouches, and tears in the seating fabric lent nothing to the overal comfort. No small comfort items toothpaste, brush, eye mask etc. The two meals was served in a cardboard box with limited choice, yuck. I appreciate that airlines need on occasions to uterlise alternative aircraft (leasing) but come on.

Let me put it this way: I would have gotten to NYC sooner if I drove the whole way. I was only supposed to be traveling for about 6 hours during the day, but this trip with United required an entire day of traveling. I left Tampa around noon, and didn't get in to NYC until 2 in the morning the next day. On top of that, they managed to lose my luggage, and they still haven't found it after a day. My flight was continuously delayed until eventually they randomly decided to cancel it. I had to wait in the customer service line for well over an hour, and the representatives I tried calling were so unhelpful - it turned out there was actually an open seat on an alternate flight with a different airline leaving at an earlier time, but they didn't realize this until too late and ended up re-booking me for a red-eye flight flying out of a different airport. So I had to spend $30 for a shuttle ride to the different airport which took well over an hour. Once I got there, even the new red-eye flight got delayed by over 2 hours.

I originally bought a Marseille-LIS (Y) and a LIS-GIG (C) separately, because I did not want to pay for Business class on a domestic European flight, and I wanted a Business class on the intercontinental part. Doing so, I saved E400,00. TAP attendant and supervisors refused to send my luggage directly to Rio. They admitted they would do it if I were on an other airline from Rio to Brazil. Note that I am a Star Alliance Gold card holder. Why ? TAP has a brand new policy regarding luggages that will surprise a lot of passengers: if you connect in Lisbon from a TAP flight to another TAP flight, with two different tickets, your luggage will NOT be transferred to the second flight. You will have to collect it in Lisbon, check-in again, go to security again.. If your second flight is not a TAP ticket, your luggage will be transferred !!!! They admitted that this resulted from tariffs. Many times MRS-LIS and LIS-GIG is cheaper that MRS-LIS-GIG. And the company wants to fight with smart passengers. I had 4 hours connection in LIS. I did not like it, but I felt safe. Arrival of the plane in Marseille was one hour late, and took off 2 hours late. I made it. Comfortable leather seats with a huge pitch.

This was the third reschedule and BA charged 433.40 533.90 and 275.00 successively on a basic $1822.00 economy flight. No other airline does this in my experience. Incredibly my travel agency could not reserve me a window seat ahead of time - unless I paid an extra $53.00 for each flight. I did so but was given an aisle seat on the outbound flight anyway. Both overseas legs were on 747s that were extremely cramped for someone over 6 ft. tall. On the way out my antiquated in-flight display did not work. On the way back my headphone jack was broken. We left Heathrow 90 minutes late due to a computer glitch but for the next 12 hours the BA website indicated on time arrival so my wife waited two hours extra at SFO. Overall a very poor experience.

They could have done that within the first 20 minutes instead of wasting our 1.5 hours in that hot airport. We did not receive any apology.

But a huge queue of passengers was our destination and among them some with a transfer for a flight 3 or 4 hours later. No Airport staffwas present to direct us. We had to apologize to other people to come before them as our flight was leaving in 30 minutes as time was passing and the officer did not dare to accelerate the process of immigration control (for a transit flight!).

The Business lounge in Changi is OK, but nothing to write home about. We ordered ' book the cook' option, one chicken Brest and one Steak dish.

My tail bone tells me immediately, as I was injured in a ski accident, and I can't sit in a regular economy seat more than 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed, as Aeroflot  Business seat from Moscow to Shanghai was much softer and pampering. After take off I went to the bathroom, and upon my return I found the satay dish awaiting me. I only enjoyed the chicken stick. Then no service for almost 45 min, without one cabin staff in sight .Slowly the magic and excitement were wearing off. Eventually one  showed up and asked me if I didn't like it. I said I only liked the chicken and she offered me some more, nice gesture, but I declined. There were maybe 15 passengers in Business class,that I believe can fit 50-60 passengers. Not a tough flight for the crew. Then came a green salad, very average,and then my book the cook meal showed up, which was good. As I like to drink with my main meal, and my glass was almost empty, as it Lasted me through the salad and the Satay, it was time to refresh my glass,but not such offer. I buzzed the cabin crew,and asked for another glass of drink. I kept enjoying my meal awaiting my drink that never showed up. I buzzed the crew again,and this time the flight manager showed up, I asked to have my drink if possible with my meal not with the dessert. The Coke showed up in 5 seconds. Then came the dessert, a dish with Ice cream, no choices, and a Fruit basket, the most basic desert cart I ever saw. At that point I was already regretting the huge amount of money invested in trying to experience the top notch Business class.  Then I wanted to rest,but the crew must turn your seat upside down, very weird idea,and even with the thin mattress ,it was far from a pampering bed.IF you feel like sitting down again,you have to call the F/A to flip it over to a seat..Personaly I prefer control of my lying situation, rather than calling the FA. No amenity kit distributed, but I heard that they pass by with a choice of amenities that you may find necessary for your trip -  no such basket was offered.

I called his flight attendant  who seemed amused by my statement and said she will 'take care of him' - she brought him a small pack of nuts. So much for generosity.

I knew there were extra charges with them but I wasn't expecting to pay 55 Euros for a piece of paper that would have cost nothing to print. The clerk also told me to run because I was tight in time and that they would not wait for me. I ran for my life only to get at the gate and wait for 30 minutes because they have the worst gate management I've ever encountered in all my travels. ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Porto to Barcelona,June 2019,2.0,3.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Por,,42195

The Business Class lounge at BKK airport-their key location had the ambience of a Greyhound bus depot. Crowded uncomfortable with modest food offerings that were inedible. Flight TG 473 July 25 2014 BKK to Brisbane was awful. The so-called beds in the aircraft were not lie-flat and so uncomfortable that it was impossible to sleep. The food was poor and inedible- not even Economy standard. The flight attendants couldn't care less. So from now on it's Bye Bye Thai!,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,,1.0,no,,,12587

The airline attendants are chosen for their looks not their helpfulness or intelligence. The food is awful and the airplanes particularly the DSH-8 are old and noisy. They have obtuse rules - such as not allowing you to store your purse under the seat in front of you in an exit row.

No wait at check-in and through security in about 25 minutes. On a business class ticket you can access the Admirals Club lounge, which comes with a coupon for one free drink (including bottled water)!. Even then there's an expectation that you'll have to tip the barman who provides it. Otherwise, it's a few cheese crackers, cheese cubes and assorted nuts. There's a water fountain in the lounge, if you're really thirsty. Boarding was quick and stress free, and the refurbished Boeing 767-300 business class cabin offers a lof of personal space. There was a very long and unexplained wait after boarding until the doors were closed, and a further wait until pushback. You'd think that the flight attendants would be thinking ahead to how they'd be able to get on with service quicker on a night flight, such as taking dinner and drinks orders, but no, all standing around in the galley chatting. After take-off the flight attendants got out of their seats after 30 minutes. The next step was to manually log out 30 entertainment tablets and noise-cancelling earphones, so that was another 30 minutes gone. It was 90 minutes from take-off before the first drink hit the table. Dinner orders were then taken, and the meal service got under way. The cabin was kept at full illumination, with no attempt to create any form of night-time ambience. The starter was a mushroom carpaccio, which was very tasty, followed by what you'd think would a safe option 'steak in demi-glaze of blue-cheese'. The demi-glaze looked like oatmeal, and the steak was bloody in the middle, so after a few cuts, the blood started running everywhere, and it quickly became a pink, inedible mess. The dessert was ice-cream, which took a full 15 minutes before you could even crack off a chip with a spoon. The flight attendants were regularly doing the rounds throughout the flight, and nobody wanted for a drink. I passed on on the breakfast option of a quiche lorraine and spicy sausage, as this seemed like the perfect recipe for early-morning heartburn.

We should get treated equally, we all pay to get here and many flyers are American so why get treated different. The customs agent was so rude, was yelling at people as if we were whole bunch ignorants, that was uncalled for. What bothers me about Spirit staff is that they did not bother to let us know we were going to miss our connection flight.

Leaving the flight was reasonable but one had to use a transfer bus followed by a series of staircases none of which would be suitable for elderly people. There were no staff at hand to help.

18676,United Airlines,1,United Airlines customer review,2015-05-16,False,UA 895 4/11/15 UA 99 5/2/15. In my job I average 175k miles of travel a year primarily with UA and their Star Alliance partners. As a 1K I enjoy personalized attention with UA such as automatic rebooking on cancelled flights or missed connections. I fly coach but with my status I frequently get upgrades domestically. Although I'm qualified for 6 global upgades a year that hasn't happened since 2010 when both my wife and SIL received Business Class seats MUC-ORD (prior to the merger with Continental). Unfortunate but could be a sign of the health of the economy that those seats are being purchased. At any rate I am very happy with the service I get from UA and even though I live near ORD I have had very few cancellations or delays of significance flying in or out of Chicago. Prices are competitive and schedules are great making it very easy to co-ordinate travel to Asia or Europe. While I fly Delta and SkyTeam partners occasionally I will fly UA and partners if at all possible. Most recent travel was 747-400 ORD-HKG outbound to Taiwan and MEL-LAX (787-9) and LAX-ORD (757) homebound.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,yes,,,20498

During my 7.5 hour flight from Atlanta to Anchorage the WiFi was not working and the TV was not working. When I brought this to the attention of the flight attendant she acted like I was an inconvenience. She was also very rude to the other passengers as well. I am currently sitting in the Anchorage airport waiting to return to Orlando and they are not staffed at the check in desk. I have 10 other passengers with me currently. They do not have a phone number provided to call for service. The other airlines near by say that the Delta employees commonly do not pay attention to there check in desks.

Southwest’s response was sorry these things happen, you should have been here sooner. We were prepared for our flight when we got to airport, we were at TSA but could not go any farther because of a change they made. And they said it was our fault. Lost $3000.00. Got reimbursed $0.00.

A very disappointing experience this time around, not that I was expecting other the top service but it was below average. To start off, the Check-In was slow as the Ground Team was more worried about having a briefing then prioritising the passengers. I wasn't given a fast track pass through security as they had none even when they seem to be organised. Upon boarding, again there was no priority for High Tiered and Premium passengers and main reason being it was a bus gate. The Crew onboard were very mediocre, absolutely no one stood out even with their extra touches. Pre-departure drinks took a long time to get around with a very basic amenity kit given straight after. The catering was okay nothing amazing with selections or taste. At least the IFE was decent, plenty of options though I couldn't compare it with Emirates offering. Overall I think the Team needs to be more personal, smile more and prioritise the passengers.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to Auckland,April 2018,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,yes,Sydney,Auckland,6598

They are very attentive and engaging and make sure their customers are getting the best service they can provide. The initial delays caused us to miss our connection and Iceland Air's staff did their best to take care of us and others on our flight. The Captains provided relevant weather info concerning potential turbulence. They reassured their customers, especially those who don't deal well with it, that it's normal and everyone is in good hands. We saw a few white knucklers relax after the announcements.

The small but useful convenience kit even in economy is a nice touch. The seats were standard, the entertainment more than adequate and the food average. Slept 8 hours in the 13 hour flight. Comfortable blankets and the head support on the seat is a nice thing to have. Check in was smooth, baggage arrived intact, connection was a breeze, and the US pre-clearance meant that exit at JFK was easy.

I have a very small carry on roller that they would not let me carry on even though it was under weight and would have fit easily in the overhead. They claimed that it would not because the Airbus 319 did not have big enough overhead bins and it would not fit under the seat - I had to pay an extra $45 each way to bring my bag - which far surpassed the savings.

The seats were so close together with hardly any leg room or arm movement that not only was it difficult to eat the food which was dreadful but very difficult to get in and out of without damaging or twisting a knee or back. We had extreme exhaustion on landing from discomfort and lack of sleep. The evening meal we were served was inedible. The pasta had been hanging around for some time by the appearance. It was dry and congealing in what was once tomato sauce. The foil container was bent and the foil cover crumpled which proves it had been handled and heated up frequently. As for the breakfast in a box it was so bad I cannot comment. We've had better food and seating on low budget airlines and as well as on Myanmar Airlines! We want to support our national airline but definitely not on BA economy. It seems all the attention and care is given to first and business class.

85558,American Airlines,1,"""never consider using American again""",2024-01-26,True,"  My trip with American Airlines had multiple issues that occurred throughout the day and they were not all weather related as the airline tried to blame it on. I do know that many other planes landed and took off while our plane circle the airport on Flight Aware, before being re-routed to another airport. due to this, the next flight I was placed on was delayed due to an inoperable jetway and then another delay due to the push vehicle not functioning, which had to be disconnected from the plane and have a new one brought in. Then, once finally in Chicago, flight 6030, the plane I was told by one of the AA representatives in Houston that I would be in the first (Priority) standby position, was delayed due to a maintenance issue. This plane was delayed due to a switch on the plane that was malfunctioning. Eventually, it was determined that the repair could not be made and so that flight was switched to another plane at another gate. Once at the new gate, I am told I am in the second standby position and not the first as I was told I would be. As I now mentioned to the attendant at the new gate, I only had limited time to get to the bus terminal to catch the last bus of the night back to Milwaukee, my final destination, if I was not seated on this flight. They advised me I would get a seat and that I should wait until boarding was completed. I was not given a seat on this plane which led to me missing the last bus of the night to Milwaukee. I then went back to an AA representative to find out when was the next flight I could be put on to Milwaukee. I was informed it would be around 1:00 PM on the following day. Of course the expectation (as told to me by AA personnel) was for me to spend the night in the airport waiting for this plane. At this point, I chose to hire an Uber ride back to Milwaukee at a cost of $108.00 plus a tip. So, there were far more things that went on besides a simple weather delay. I was looking for compensation for mechanical breakdowns, my aggravation at being misled by AA personnel and the cost of my Uber ride. AA then offered me a $25.00 voucher for use on my next flight with them, along with an explanation that this was all their policies would allow for. I typically fly Southwest Airlines and have never experienced such poor customer relations as I did in this instance with American Airlines.
