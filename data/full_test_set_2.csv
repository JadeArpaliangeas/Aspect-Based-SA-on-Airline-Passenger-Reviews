342,VivaColombia,1,"""I had a horrible experience""",2017-05-05,False,  Cartagena to Medellin. After booking and paying for my ticket online I never recieved a confirmation or a receipt by email. The flight information was also wrong on the website arrival time was 11:45 pm but was written 11:45 am. There was no gate number provided either and the flight number was wrong as well. I had to come so early to the airport to recieve my receipt and yet they still charged me for a boarding pass print. With all the miscommunication and misinformations I am very unsatisfied with the service and employee and management handling the situation.  And as I am writing this the flight is delayed causing even more inconveniences.

1073,Vueling Airlines,1,"""Never again with Vueling""",2016-02-26,False,"Traveling with 2 persons and 2 cats from Saint Petersburg to Santiago de Compostela in Spain for 590 Euro. The Vueling aircraft to depart at 6 am broke down at arrival in our departure aiport Saint petersburg in Russia. Staff had us leav main terminal area to hide us in back room terminal area at unused gate first. Then half an hour later we had to go all the way back an leave gate area altogether to check in counters, where we were told that plane would only depart at 4 pm, so 1 hours later, as a replacement crew and plane was being sent all the way from Spain. No food and beverage coupons were issued thn. People like us who stayd at private addresses in LED were told to travel back at pur own expense to those homes (1.5 hour away) and wait for a call to come back to airport later. Taxi costs would be reimbursed. Vueling offered fake alternative to cancel flight, but would only refund money two weeks later, which was useless at that moment of course. Despite requests to tell what woudl happen with connecting flights no staff member wanted to commit to anything but told us they would take care of them. Upon picking up luggage (complex operation) which was already in other area checked in and driving back far way to house, we got a call shortly after to return that flight would leave 3 hours earlier. Upon arrival at LED airport restaurant vouchers were issued but useless as flight would leave in less than an hour and restaurants were all booked. So we had no food since coupons can only be spent in restaurants. Plane still left half an hour late so in total 7.5 hour late and they were selling drinks and food on the plane instead of providing passengers with them for free for the inconvenience. No sense of redemption. Upon arrival in Barcelona the information given for where the counter for transits would be was wrong. Eventually we found the counter ad they confirmed the problem of getting cnecting flights and referred us to another counter with a waiting line. At that counter they told us there was no more connecting flight to SCQ (Santiago) , which any dim wit would know, so no news. They could only offer us a flight to an airport 1 1/2 hour away from Santiago (plus same distance from our home) plus bus transportation to Santiago or stay overnight in Barcelona (imagine, with 2 cats) in hotel and fly the next day direct. A restaurant coupon was given again, again useless as the flight would leave very soon. So we still had no food. We took the flight to the other city and on arrival there was no one to welcome us for the transfer to a cab or bus to Santiago, plus it was already very late. So we had to rent at our own expense an expensive car and had to cancel with costs our own prepaid 5 day rental in Santiago and drive our rental home instead of to Santiago. It all cost us 100s of Euros extra and of course the stress of an extra travel time of 11 hours, plus the extra time spent on returning a car rental the next days in a different far away town. Upon contacting Vueling about paying our costs, they refused to pay taxi costs and took zero responsibility saying they were not obliged to pay us anything (despite the laws saying opposite). We escalated it to a few passenger claim services. It seems we may succeed with one out of 3 of those to get what is due, but it will take a while. Never again with Vueling.

I wonder why all the other renowned airlines despite Covid 19 offer you a decent business class service and Turkish Airlines do not. Nice excuses to skimp on services but at the same time asking for normal business class fares as in before Covid 19 times (1400 Euros). Absolutely not worth it and certainly will not book business class again before they get their act together. FQ travellers compare, make decisions accordingly and switch to the best when necessary.

15367,United Airlines,1,"""hands off the worst airline""",2022-11-17,True,"  United is hands off the worst airline. I was traveling to visit my fiancé for thanksgiving. And I had just finished my last final in medical school so I was really happy but United ruined it. It all started when I tried checking in my bag. I am a United credit card holder so logically my first bag is supposed to be free. I tried adding the bag through the app but it kept charging me. So I contacted the customer service who requested me to seek help at the airport kiosk or the staff and reassured that it should be an easy fix. I agreed to it. When I sought help at the airport, the staff including the supervisor proceeds to tell me that I bought my flight with my miles so I am not eligible to check in my bag for free even though I am a card member. I tell them that the customer service rep confirmed that none of that should be a problem. They tell me to bring an email stating that. Now where am I supposed to find an email? I call the customer service again. Again, this is happening an hour and a half prior to my flight. The customer service rep tells me it shouldn’t be a problem. Miles are considered rewards not punishment. I try to hand over the phone to the United staff at MIA and they refuse to talk to him. They keep saying they want to see an email. The customer service rep tells me he can’t send any email other than a generic one per the airline policy. So the United staff at MIA leaves me at that without any help. The customer service rep tells me that I should just pay for the bag and request a refund later. As much as I didn’t want to go through the whole process of requesting a refund and all that, I agreed to it it because I didn’t want to let this ruin my day. Then, I head over to TSA, the nice lady checks my boarding pass and points me to the general line. But this man comes in and asks me to get my ID out before I even enter the line. Note that, there is a huge line at TSA (I am no where close to the TSA guy). I tell him that I have it right here in my hand’s reach but he won’t let me enter the line unless he sees it in my hand. I tell him the line is so long and I don’t want to drop it. Still, he won’t let me go in until he sees my ID in my hand. I have flown so many times in my entire life and I never had anyone stop me at the beginning of line and manhandled me like this. Then at TSA screen, their machine breaks and they lose my mac. I end up finding it in another lane. oh also, my flight gets delayed. I am not exaggerating. This is all happening in the same day. Once I get in the flight, the flight goes smoothly. But now I am worried because the arrival time is too close to the departure time of my connecting flight. Even after everything happened, I was hopeful that United will do its due diligence like every other airline, and hold the flight for at least 10min because that should be enough to get the passengers in from the delayed flight. Also, perhaps that the crew members would help these passengers out first to accommodate the delay. I am sorry but that just has been my experience with American and southwest. They just understood and helped. Little things but made a huge difference. But United did not do any of those. They had zero communications and did not make accommodations. Couple other passengers and I ran 30 gate gates over in 10min just do find that they closed the gate even though there is 10min left, means there was no communication about the delayed flight.

The aircraft a super old 777-200 took us from LA to Honolulu, the most embarrassing 777-200 I have ever seen in my life, it had no IFE, you had to stream it to your device.

No matter how hard they try to show they have a personality or try to be friendly it is just evident they are faking it and this is visible in the way they work. They don't come around the cabin with rounds of water, snacks etc, they don't interact with passengers stretching out in the galley etc. Even if you are carrying trash in your hand they will continue talking to each other totally ignoring you until you disturb them and ask.

Before the pandemic (covid) if you booked and paid for your ticket approx 3 months in advance you used to get a nice discount, not any more. I guess United are trying to get back the money they lost during the pandemic and it is screw the elderly (who are promised a discount but do not get one), and the frequent flyers. I have just paid for my wife's ticket and the previous day to her flight caused a price increase of $500.00, guess United presume the price of gas is going to skyrocket on July 19th. Looked at the price for my ticket going in September and I get a discount of $45.00 I am surprised they can afford it. The food has never been good and United are not the only airline this applies to, but now it is even worse, I mean they should be embarrassed beyond belief. You now need to pay for anything descent. I am pleased and surprised they do not charge for the wheelchair to take me to the gate, that is of course when you can get someone with a wheelchair, I have a bad heart and a pacemaker but sending someone with a wheelchair does not make United any money, in fact causes them to spend some, so I understand.

16720,United Airlines,1,"""never fly with United Airlines again""",2019-05-20,True,"  United Airline has completely failed us during each leg of our trip from the US to Europe. Not only did they cancel our connecting flight from Brussel to Budapest due to an inexplicable 'scheduled change' but they did not book us on another flight. If we had no caught this ahead of time, we would have been stranded in Brussels. After calling United Airlines and speaking to their customer service department, they informed me that this 'scheduled change' was not their fault and therefore they were not entitled to find a solution for us. After spending 2 hours on the phone with them, they finally agreed to book us new flights so that we could reach our final destinations at the beginning and the ending of our trip. For 2 hours United Airlines attempted to book us on flights with different returning dates or routes with extreme layovers (over 10 hours) and I had to fight with them to finally get a travel itinerary that was almost similar to the original travel itinerary that we paid for. The customer service team was extremely rude and reminded me throughout the call that this was a courtesy they were performing that they would not do it for me again. On top of all the pre-flight chaos, the flight itself was extremely uncomfortable and the crew was rude. When we finally began to board our return flights back to the US there was no information about our flight anywhere within the Munich Airport and we had to ask 5 people working at the airport before we were told where the United Airline gates are located. Because it seems that United Airlines has a pattern of causing stress and chaos for their customers it was no surprise that our boarding passes did not include our Gate information. The Munich airport also treats United Airlines extremely poorly and the terminal in which all of the gates are located is extremely bare bones (only a restroom). Once you enter the terminal, after crossing 4 checkpoints, you are not permitted to exit back into the rest of the airport where the shops and restaurants are located. This is extremely uncomfortable when United Airlines has booked you a flight with a 5-hour layover in the early morning hours. Finally, while we waited during our layover in Munich, we attempted to check-in for our next United Airlines flight (IAD to CHS) but the mobile app was unresponsive. When we were finally able to check-in via my laptop, we were told that we have to pay for our checked bags AND our carry on bags. This was not mentioned to us at any time during my 2 hours call with customer service or listed in any confirmation emails. To say that this is one of the worst, if not the worst, airline in the skies in a complete understatement.

Worst airline I have ever flown and I am not the type to leave negative reviews. Firstly our flight from Melbourne to LAX boarded on time but then we sat on the tarmac for 4 hours due to 'computer failures'. Finally we took off, and an enormous amount of water poured through the aircraft ceiling and landed on a passenger near me, soaking her completely. We missed our connection from LA to Mexico City and were put on another flight. On the way home things really got bad. We had booked a flight from Mexico City to Melbourne with one connection in LA. We received an email from United saying they had changed our itinerary to Mexico City - Houston - LA - Melbourne, with no explanation. There were also very short transfer times in each airport. Of course, we missed our connection in Houston (where we were also instructed by United to pick up our bags and recheck them, which was ridiculous given the timeframe), and then were put onto another flight from Houston to LA, which gave us 20 minutes in LA to make our flight to Melbourne or else we would be stuck there for another day. When we asked if we would be provided with a hotel, we were told ""Sorry, none of this is our fault"". We rushed and somehow made the flight to Melbourne in 20 minutes, which was incredibly stressful. Arrived home thinking it was all over, and they had lost one of our bags.

The plane took off at 10.40 pm (Singapore local time), and was supposed to arrived at 8:10 am on the 30 of January. But, after 2h30 the pilot inform us he decided to turn back to Singapore, because of a small crack in the window. We didn’t receive more information. We couldn’t reach the wifi to contact our friends and family to explain them the situation. After 2h30 we arrived in Singapore again. We had to wait 2 hours in the airport in the middle of the night (4:45am to 6:45am, Singapore hours), all tired, stress, and angry. For all of this inconvenience we received a small bag with snacks and a small bottle of water, so not even a proper meal. We finally arrive at Gold Coast airport at 2:10pm (Singapore hours) instead of 8:10am.

Even indicated what was a “low” bid with less chance of getting the upgrade, so we paid a higher bid that gave us a “fair” chance. Shortly before our flight we received an email that we were approved and could book our seats. We immediately went to the seat selections and found only 4 seats available, none together or even close. We called Singapore Airlines but they said there was nothing available and our prior seats in economy were now taken. We again asked at the counter when we checked in but same answer - no seats available. We are in our 70’s and had to sit rows apart on different sides of the aircraft for this very long flight. One of the seats was in the last row of economy plus and was so cramped it was very difficult to get in and out to use the restroom. We suffered. When we returned home, we found out Singapore Airlines would not even give miles for the flight since it was initially booked in economy. We requested our money back as we felt taken and deceived with the charge, lack of disclosure, and the unacceptable and poor quality service provided.

We tried to call Customer Service, the Spirit recording informed us that to talk with a representative costs $25, because that employee costs money. And the plane itself? The seats were cracked pleather, with worn and dirty armrests. Whatever they charge, it's too much for those seats. Coach seating - a 17th century slave ship had more leg room. The seats are small, they do not recline, and the seat backs are bare metal. Not good for your face in an emergency landing.

My boyfriend and I travel very often, and ALWAYS get business class seats for not just the comfortable seating but most importantly the service and respect. This has been present in every flight we have ever taken, besides this one. We boarded the plane and everything was lovely; seats were nicely prepared and comfortable. We sat and got settled in when one of the staff came around with the normal complimentary champagne which was greatly appreciated. We even asked for a second glass before take off, and were given it no problem at all. Once the flight took off, we were waiting for the normal first class flight attendants to come around and refresh our beverages. We got nothing, only eyes gearing the other way from our seats while we were trying to get the attention from one of the three attendants servicing our area. So, we decided to wait patiently for an hour and a half from take-off when they came around asking what we would like for dinner. My boyfriend and I both asked our separate flight attendants for a refresher, which we were then told we had to wait till after dinner was served (Never have we ever been told no, or ""wait"" in first class) again, one of the reasons we chose to spend thousands on these special seats. Finally we got our second drink after 2 hours had passed at this point. I asked for a glass or champagne and wine, and was told by a male flight attendant, ""you can only have one"" while my boyfriend sat with two glasses next to me, and also before take-off we were given two glasses of champagne? That made no sense and felt extremely weird energy from the staff after this. He then came back and asked if I'd like that second drink now, and I responded “yes please” remaining respectful and grateful. As he comes back for the third time about 20-30 minutes after the second glass was poured, he offers me another drink, but throws in “would you like to start with a glass of water first?” I felt very uncomfortable that he offered me water, without me asking for it, and awkwardly accepted the water. I have never in my 8 years of flying business/first class been asked a question like he did, especially when I was completely reserved and respectful, not one bit out of character. And after he had said/acted this way towards me, the flight attendant that was servicing my boyfriend was approaching him to ask him if he'd like another drink as well. The staff quickly walked to the other side and whispered something in that employee's ear while he was in the middle of pouring my boyfriend a drink, and again, that flight attendant asked him “would you like a glass of water to start with?”. My boyfriend firmly said “No, I would not” as he was officially picking up on the disrespect and completely uncalled for attitude towards both of us. We both became extremely irritated and felt very welcomed and disrespected. We have flown on countless airlines, business/first class seats, and like I said earlier, have NEVER been treated with such disrespect and immatureness from first class flight attendants. We are both successful people and enjoy being treated with respect wherever we go, which is why, like I said, we spend our hard earned money to get that same treatment.",A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Sydney,December 2022,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no,Bangkok,Sydney,36923

The plane departed around 15 minutes later than published but was able to overcome and arrived earlier in Doha! Was a very smooth landing and the crew were all warm! Food served dinner and breakfast were both sumptuous and delicious! I was seated on a window seat and was quiet cramped because the guy beside me was humungous. Arrival in Doha was as expected very warm and pleasant, security check was fast and quick! A separate lounge for Silver members were provided, and was surprised of its huge size, very comfortable, good food, very clean comfort rooms! Went to the gate early as it was quiet far but thanks to the sky train, I was at my gate in seconds! Fortunately, I was upgraded to Business Class on the second leg of the journey! It was a very pleasant experience considering the 13 hours flight to Montreal! Everything went perfectly well! The very comfortable Q Suite, the award winning Catering and the Best Crew Services contributed to an overall pleasant experience!

The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time.

On the 9th we get to the Airport to return to Albuquerque from Puerto Rico. We are told our flight is delayed 3 hours and will miss our reconnecting flight in New York. After being in line and taking with the reps for 2 hours we are told the only flight from NY to ABQ for us is on July 14th. We are told there is nothing they can do for us in Puerto Rico and must fly to NY to see what they can do there. They cancel our reconnecting flight as we are not going to be there in time and rebook it for the 14th. So now I have my family on a flight to NY not knowing what we are supposed to do when we get there. We land in NY and go to the JetBlue counter. The lady says they have no rooms available and cannot rent us a car to drive home but will call her manager. The manager walks up saying “Stick to your guns, No, No, No” before even looking at our file on the screen and what’s happening. We again are told there is nothing they can do for us. I have myself, my wife, 3 kids and my mother in the airport being told we have nowhere to stay and cannot get a flight for 5 days. We frantically start calling my wife’s aunt who lives in NY but are unable to get ahold of them. The Manager says the only thing he can do is get us a Lyft to their house. We explained we haven’t gotten ahold of anyone but with nothing else to do we accept. They then get us a Lyft that is too small! After begging the driver to take us as it’s now 12am and we have been in lines for 3 hours at NY JetBlue customer service he allows us to pile in and place luggage all over our laps. We’re taking to my wife’s Aunts apartment and dropped off in front of a locked door as a sign that says “Doorman will be back in 5 min is posted”. So now my family is standing outside a locked door in NY in the rain.  The doorman let’s us in and says we can’t stay there without permission. So again, here we are being thrown out on the streets of NY by JetBlu. Thank God after about 30min we were able to get permission to go in as they are out of town but the doorman has spare keys. I am simply hoping our flight on the 14th goes through now! To add insult I got an email today from JetBlue they are sorry for the travel issues and have given a credit of $50.

We gate checked our stroller and car seat only for the gate agent to tell us that we would have to retrieve it at baggage claim and it would not be brought to the gate. Completely defeats the purpose of checking in at the gate. Next was how our baggage was handled.

Then on arrival at least 20-30% of the passengers received an email that some or all of their luggage did not make the transfer. This must be laziness on the part of the ground crew in Helsinki because there is no reason this many bags did not make the flight. People with kid, people with turn around flights, people with transfers to other cities and countries were being told their bags would not arrive for 2 days or more. Our car seat that was gate checked was placed on the carousel not the oversized baggage belt. The frame was damaged and it has been over one month and Finnair has not even responded to the emails or claims we have made in their system. This is unacceptable, our carseat ended up being delayed for 3 days and Finnair has not even reimbursed us for having to rent one for those days from the car rental agency.

60400,Delta Air Lines,1,"""Delta needs to reevaluate their staff""",2022-04-19,True," I’ve never been treated like less than a human being more than when speaking to Delta employees. I was trapped in Panama, after arriving to the airport 3 hours early to my flight. They refused to let me check my bag, which I was fine with, I was even about to throw out the whole bag. After saying this they then proceeded to tell me I cannot board my flight, and could not give me a legitimate reason as to why. The exact words I was told was “oh well you should've got here earlier. She told me she could book me a new flight for the next day and said the price would be $400 when online the same exact flight was $144. She then handed me a piece of paper with a help number to call which I couldn’t call because I do not have international calls on my phone plan and refused to let me use a phone. When I asked for a supervisor or manager she brought me 4 different guys that were not a supervisor or manager and lied saying they were. I had to pay another cab back to my hotel and also pay for another night there. Finally back in America, I’ve been calling everyday Delta customer service to speak to a representative and on hold 5 hours for the past 4 days which every time I get to 5 hours it just magically disconnects. Finally I got through to someone, she was the sweetest person who works at Delta, and shortly after being connected we were disconnected. I tried calling one more time today, and after 5 hours and 45 mins I was connected with someone, I explained to her the situation and this lady now that I was speaking to was even worse than the workers at Panama Airport. Overall Delta needs to reevaluate their staff, this is so completely unacceptable.

62720,easyJet,1,"""they have done everything in their power to wriggle out of paying""",2021-08-26,False,"  On Friday 13th August at roughly 20.00hrs our flight from Gibraltar to Gatwick was cancelled due to fog. After waiting another hour in the departure lounge, we were informed ‘Easyjet have been unable to find an alternative route or accommodation for the night. Please leave the airport by Gate number 5 and arrange your own accommodation’. After a frantic search online it did appear that all the hotels in Gibraltar were full. We were able to make contact with the host of the AirBNB that we had been staying at for the previous three nights and although his AirBNB was full, he made space for us in another property and charged us £160 for the emergency one nights stay. We took a taxi to his place and stayed the night. During the night we received an email from EasyJet informing us that our flight would take place at 18.00 the following day, 14th August. We therefore had to spend another whole day in Gibraltar. Obviously, we needed to eat and drink for our additional time there. At the end of this extra day, we took another taxi back to Gibraltar airport and thankfully our next flight left on time. A few days later we submitted an expenses claim to Easyjet for 2 x taxi transfers, 1 night’s accommodation and for meals and drinks during the day we were delayed. Easyjet have agreed to pay for one of our taxi journeys only! They have stated – the second taxi expense did not show a ‘route’ on the receipt so they will not pay. The food and drinks receipts we submitted were not itemised so they will not pay. The accommodation receipt did not have a date stamp on it (even though it was dated the 14th August the day after we should have gone home) so they will not pay. Easyjet flight cancellation actually cost us £289.00 and they have agreed to reimburse us £20! Not only did they treat us like animals and leave us stranded at Gibraltar airport with nowhere to stay, but when we claimed our valid expenses they have done everything in their power to wriggle out of paying.

The seats are old and screens often don't work properly. On my flight from Dubai to Kuwait, on the A380, my seat was not even clean and i found toothbrush protection on the cocktail table. Second, on my 4 flights during my trip, only 1 crew was attentive and nice to me. The others were not caring about passengers and were snobby and arrogant. Dinner is served on a tray and food not nicely presented (i'd call it economy in business). As for beverages (I usually drink wine during dinner), you can't expect it to be served after you finished your dinner. The crew were disorganized.

In particular, they accommodated a small bamboo stool (souvenir) that was marginally over the luggage dimensions though fitted OK into the larger overhead lockers (ground staff wanted to put it in the hold). They also greeted me by name on the DXB-MAN flight and offered to show me how all the seat / screen controls worked. The seats were very comfy on both the new Boeing 777 (RGN-DXB) and the older A380 (DXB-MAN). I asked to change my breakfast from Express to Continental and the cabin crew agreed immediately.

They gave us a meal voucher and said that is the best they could do. The staff said because of immigration rules they cannot offer anything to passengers if it is less than 8 hours. There was no empathy and I do not blame the staff from connections to the lounges we spoke to, as they kept referring there are no managers on duty who are empowered to authorize a place to rest and this is standard policy for missed flights arising due to delays.

I have travelled several times in the past on Etihad and I always rated it above many other airlines. However, that impression was totally destroyed with just concluded travel in January 2017.

We were on a Boeing 777 (Toronto to Abu Dhabi) and quite shocked to see we were right on the tail even though we booked the tickets 3 months in advance. The seat was very narrow and extremely uncomfortable added to that the seat I was sitting was defective - would not move, so I had to travel 12.5 hours in upright position. Added to that, the entertainment unit was flickering non-stop so I could not use the unit as well. The airline requested us to update our profile so that they know our preferences in advance. However, it looks like a gimmick. The menu card was provided on one side but not to us. When the crew came to serve us, they said all that they have was vegetarian and we accepted but the quality was just horrible. Overall, it was horrible experience. Our flight from Abu Dhabi to Mumbai was on A340, the seat was better but service was a stinker. Again, we were seated right at the tail end and they could only serve us vegetarian! On the way back we were on A380 on BOM-AUH. Great experience, the seats were good but again, we were on seats 85E/F - the tail end. They could only serve us Vegetarian but this time we refused to eat. We asked for a glass of water and my wife took a glass of Sprite. Mysteriously, after 3 minutes the waitress comes with non vegetarian food! My question is what is happening with this airline? Are we supposed to fight for our food option? That is it.

The A380 upper deck is quiet and the business suite is excellent, it is worth noting that if you are traveling as a couple you should book the forward facing centre seats as the other options will not allow you to sit together.

The food quality and choice was excellent and the cabin crew were friendly and really did try to make sure that you had everything you needed. On each flight the flight attendant introduced themselves and asked if you had any questions or requirements during the flight, on one leg my wife decided not to eat and they double checked before landing that she didn't want a quick snack, again good attention to detail.

However coming back to London the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging.

The first staff member at the entrance told me that I had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat, if no one could help then he will try to come. So that’s what I did, but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasn’t allowed to carry a bag unless I help her and even after explaining the situation, she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase. Luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end.

79249,Air New Zealand,1,"""My seat was uncomfortable""",2019-11-29,True,"  Los Angeles to Auckland. I haven't flown Air New Zealand since 2011, and I was looking forward to using them again. I had only ever had good experiences with this airline, and expected no different this time. Perhaps I was spoiled the last time I few to NZ because I traveled on American Airlines' B787, and it was a pleasant experience. But then, I have also traveled on Air New Zealand's 777 before, and enjoyed that, so I really don't know what has changed. However, the fact is, my well-seasoned (25+ years) rolling carry on would not fit down the aisle once I got to steerage, and I was forced to turn it sideways and lift it. It wasn't that I couldn't make it fit, but I had to slightly angle it each time I went past a seat. This probably should have been a warning sign! My seat was uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, in fact, that my left buttock became positively painful. Not sore, painful. It felt like I was sitting on some kind of ridge. The seat was hard, and I suffered cramps for 24 hours after landing as a result. Although I was lucky enough to have a free seat next to me (the plane was full), the shape of the seats made it such that it really wasn't the benefit that perhaps it could have been. Now, the cabin crew was good, and I'm not faulting the service, although it would have been nice if water could have been brought around more than once. The entertainment was fine, and I loved the free wifi, USB port and socket for every seat. The temperature seemed to vary a lot from cold to very warm, and the air was dry (I am comparing it to the 787 here, it's true). But, it was just so very uncomfortable that I cannot see myself using ANZ again. I had considered bidding on an upgrade, but I missed the deadline. When I walked past business class and saw the pods, I was glad I had missed it. They looked really small, cramped, and ""open"". However, as I have never actually flown business class (in 55 years of flying), I can only comment on my perception here. So, in short, I could have paid $250 more for American Airlines and had a much more comfortable trip, along with an extra bag.

I had given him the 32 degree masks from Costco and they slip. The flight attendant reminded my son to pull up his mask, which he did. Not too long after the flight attendant came to me and told me he had reminded us a lot to put up our masks. My husband told him it had only been two times. The steward began to argue with my husband. I told the steward a firm thank you and he left. At this point I didn't dare rest my eyes. I kept checking my children's masks. My oldest sons mask did slip down again but I would hurry and make sure he had it up. Not once did we ever refuse to wear our masks. Not once were we unruly or trying to be a problem on the flight. We were in the last row of the plane right next to the flight attendant cabin. We could hear them talking bad about the passengers and how awful they were. They seemed really worked up. I then heard the steward say they might have law enforcement waiting for someone at the end of the flight. I heard another female flight attendant say, "" I didn't ask for that to happen."" He responded, ""Well it's done!"" In the back of my mind I was thinking is he talking about us? I quieted my fears and thought it must be the man they had threatened to extradite. By the conversations I was picking up in the back from the flight attendants it seemed like this particular flight attendant really enjoyed the power and was excited to watch seeing someone get kicked off. It was like he could use it at his next gathering of flight attendants where they could tell the crazy stories of what had happened to them. Not okay at the expense of a family just trying to get home with as little problems as possible. Well luckily it wasn't law enforcement, but it was Alaska Airlines employees who handed us a letter that said our connecting flight had been canceled and we are now banned from flying with Alaska Airlines.

We cleared customs, had to go back through TSA and R A N to the connecting gate. Plane was still at the gate but gate agents refused boarding. We were told we had to go to customer service which had a 2+ hour long line. AA Screwed so many people that there were no hotel rooms left. We, and many others, slept on the grubby floor with assurances we would be on the 8 am flight Sunday. That flight was overbooked. Maybe the 10am? Not a chance, but we should stay there and keep trying. When finally asked a very direct question the gate agents confessed there was no way to get us out of there before Tuesday! 96 hours later than the time AA contracted with us by way of our paid tickets. That is unacceptable in any business. From the second the PC flight was delayed, American Airlines knew exactly where every passenger was and where they need to go. They made no attempt to get any of us where we needed to be. This could have been done while we were enroute. The attitude of the AA employees was that somehow this was the fault of the passengers.

I called the airline to see if we could cancel the old tickets and reissue for less. No is all I was told. Then, we get our tickets at the airport and they have split apart my wife an I into separate rows. I was able to switch the seats around on the CLT to LAS and pay a premium for legroom. That was the only way we could sit together. I am 64, have traveled the world for business and pleasure very often in my career and this is the first time the airline separated us. We get our boarding pass at the curbside check in in Las Vegas and go to our gate. We happened to look at the tickets and we were three rows apart again. I went to the desk and they just shrugged it off as the computer picks the seats. Again, if we paid more to upgrade our seat we could sit together. By the way, I always tip the sky cap $5 to check my bags curbside and get my boarding pass. The man there had no problem accepting my tip and then he asked if I was paying for the curbside service with the same card I was using for the bag.  Oh yeah, there is a sign there that they are charging a $3 per bag service fee for curbside baggage handling. We did upgrade to sit together and our connecting flight in Charlotte NC got delayed twice. We were to be home by 11pm but instead we got home at 1:30 am and had to get up for work in the morning. The insult to inury was that only one of the two bags we checked made it to our final destination. They told me they would deliver to my house before noon the next day and that was fine as we had to be at work at noon.

As a teacher with a job I cannot miss, this was extremely inconvenient. No explanations were offered about the delay, except that the plane was arriving late from it's last location. The announcements of delays were very late, right around the 4pm scheduled departure time, well after they were informed of a delay (2:30pm, according to the national reservation office). This left no time to find alternative flights for the same day. I had to spend an hour in the lobby calling the national reservation office multiple times to check on flights from neighboring airports, even Dulles and Reagan International, several hours away, but there was no time (or vouchers for transportation) to get there.

93305,Aeromexico,1,"""failed to meet even the most basic standards""",2023-06-06,True," If you ever consider flying with Aeromexico, I strongly advise against it. In my personal experience, this airline has demonstrated a lack of professionalism and reliability. One of the major issues I encountered is their frequent changes in flight areas without providing sufficient means for passengers to stay informed. The availability of screens displaying these changes is limited, and there is a notable absence of announcements in English or bilingual employees to assist non-Spanish speakers. During my journey, which involved a stopover in Mexico City on both the outbound and return flights, I encountered a distressing situation involving my 87-year-old grandmother. Aeromexico staff separated her from the rest of our party, despite the presence of completely vacant seats on one of the flights where we could have easily been accommodated together. When we approached the employees for assistance, they claimed there was nothing they could do, leaving us feeling frustrated and disappointed. Regrettably, the most appalling customer service experience occurred on our return journey, as well as on our way to our destination. All members of our travel group contracted a parasite during our trip. As we were boarding the flight, the airline initially announced that they would wait for a passenger in the bathroom, only to abruptly change their decision and close the doors, leaving us behind. It is common for groups traveling together to prefer not to leave anyone behind, and this unexpected action forced us to endure a gruelling 12-hour wait at the airport. Even after spending approximately $580 per person for the return trip, we encountered further rudeness from the Aeromexico staff during security procedures. Considering the involvement of three countries in our travels, one would expect a certain level of customer service, but unfortunately, Aeromexico failed to meet even the most basic standards.

Upon my arrival at the airport to check in I received a message that my flight was delayed. No one informed me about my rights according to the EU's legislation. Glad that I knew about it. I contacted Finnair regarding this but they made it very difficult to find the right form to fill in. Unlike for example British Airways where you can find the form easily and they compensate you within a few days. My flight was delayed on Dec 21 and all I got from Finnair is ""I'm going to investigate to find out what happened and will get back to you."" I know what happened, all I want is my compensation that I am entitled to. Also, I got to the airport in HEL to catch my flight but I ended up standing in line for an hour because the passport controls were not open. In the end I only had 10 minutes left before boarding and I did not get to use the lounge at HEL. Like I said, the service onboard was good. The flat bed on A330 was nice and I managed to get a good sleep. Business class cabin was not too crowded which was good. Finnair provides wifi service onboard that costs about €20 for the entire flight unless you are a Finnair plus gold card holder, then it's free. The internet was very slow so on the way back I just used my 1-hour complimentary wifi because I just thought it was not worth paying for. The IFE is ok, not so many good movies to choose from.

I had to stay in a noisy, smelly, and crowded Golden Lounge for 7 hours of waiting with screaming kids and loud guests - the worst business lounge in the world.

We have been using a good $10-20k a month on our card, we pay $550 a year and have never had an upgrade or been treated like a status they claim, no VIP, no Standby upgrades, It’s all a load of hype with no outcomes and only empty hopes and promises. When you call, everyone just passes you on to someone else with no solutions! The accommodations were lacking and unorganized. Waiting in line for 2 hours at an airport after flights were delayed so long we missed our connecting flight, then 4 hours at baggage to wait for missed plane luggage! To finally get our luggage that was damaged, I had no medication for way to long. By 1am we could not find any place to accept the food voucher, there was no shuttle to go to a hotel Delta gave us 30 mins away by the time we finally got a hotel, my bags were damaged and we were promised to be compensated to make up for these troubles and they are not offering anything close to fair. After one hour on the phone, 3 agents, multiple answers, no help, we were passed to the lowest customer service Delta rep I have ever spoke with! This did the final for me, so inexperienced yo handle any situations for a stressed out and upset customer who has been through the loop holes to try to get reimbursed and her attitude was just nasty and rude.  Delta is horrible and don’t listen to the customer, they also are not accommodating to people who have been through a tough time during their DELTA flight issues and especially the after the flight issues. I am not a happy Delta member. We are rethinking our choices, rethinking our membership and which card/company I we should look into because of the whole process of this last month with Delta and how they have been handling our situation is the worst experience I have ever had, ruining our family experience that is so hard to have and put together with our demanding schedules these days of precious time and a waste of my sanity and yearly money.",,Family Leisure,First Class,Buffalo to Fort Lauderdale,July 2023,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,no,Buffalo,FortLauderdale,65885

986,Air India,1,"""left stranded with very little options""",2022-04-30,True,"  Our flight route was from Washington DC IAD to Bengaluru via Delhi on 27th April ‘22. The scheduled stopover was 2.5 hours in which we had to complete immigration, check out baggage , go through customs and re-check in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to Bengaluru. There was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in Delhi. So we had roughly only about 1.5 hours to complete the above steps. Unfortunately, although we were able to finish all the required steps by 1:30 pm, which was the scheduled departure time, we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off. What followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller. We are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items. We received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials. We were exited out of the airport, which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage. We had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as AirIndia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to Bengaluru. The next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening. We were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us. We even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price (27K per ticket). They’ve denied even giving that to us. We were left stranded with very little options. We stayed at the airport all day looking for options. Fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate. Please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage. We finally reached Bengaluru around 2:30 AM. Ironically, this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed Srinagar flight. Glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay. I fail to understand why Air India could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage! In all, we ended spending 70K for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours. Did Air India sell our tickets to others, what could be the reason?  Immigration  Priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings. You might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight. Baggage claim: Based on your family/group, it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out. We lost a lot of time here. There was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage.  Customs and Check in luggage: While checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers. There should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage. We lost a lot of time here. Security check: Again, domestic and international passengers need to have different lines.

1847,British Airways,7,"""was a very enjoyable flight""",2017-11-20,True,"  London to Tel Aviv. Arrived at Heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). We used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improve. The food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches, soup and some dry cake. This wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. Drinks overall were good as always with British Airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling. In terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. This biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges. Smiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd! The other area which I find completely below standard are the toilets. Whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc, the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room. The regular Heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality. Whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. On board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin. This meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. These seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. Unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! British Airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! Even the Thales system is showing its age now, but this Rockwell Collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! The cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience. Some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly. Others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience. Food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet.

He asked our documents he even verify our visa validity which helps us a lot not to get in any confusions or chances not to enter the country. He gave our boarding pass and help us to check in the luggage. After that we enter with the security check walk around the duty free shops. Then our boarding was started. Before we approach to the counter for the boarding one gentle man came and suddenly started asking us too many questions and in very rude manner. Even though we have our all proper required documents for travel he started investigating us asking a questions like how many money we have, NOC from the company. Lots of the people no body were asked any questions and we were amazed that in a very rude and inappropriate manner we were told to come to side and started asking questions. It was not less than a police officer investigating a criminal. One of the guy was the one who took us at the side and give our documents to the other guy and then that guy gave our documents to the other guy and they were asking the same question. We are going on a vacation and they ruined our whole mood. At the end they took a pictures of our passport and let us go. They were very smart that they hide the front side of their employee id to make sure that nobody knows their name. Crew member were good and even the guy at the front who checked us in.

The frustration arises when individuals unrelated to Business or First class board ahead of families. Consequently, families end up sitting apart from each other. I strongly discourage choosing their ""Premium Economy,"" as it doesn't provide the promised better seating. Despite paying extra, we experienced no improvement during our two layovers on the return flight. Business class, First class, and other groups board first, rendering the premium upgrade ineffective.

The plane itself was fine, the staff very hit and miss depending on who you spoke to, footnote the entertainment system is standard and certain meals run out, mainly the chicken courses, but I kept thinking of the price. Arrived in Kuwait, 6 hours of nothing, quite possibly the most desolete airport of nothing. We were given a free meal consisting of a cheese roll, stodgy cake and an orange juice. Our connecting flight to Manila was again ok, again staff very hit and miss. Enjoyed our three week holiday and returned to Manila Ninnoy international airport for return trip on the 7 Jan 2019.

Flight back to England again ok but all the same issues as before. My thoughts on Kuwait Airways? In my humble opinion dont use them, they seem to think the customer has no choice, a ‘like it and lump it attitude’, the planes clean and tidy yet the staff were aggressive and rude.

3591,Scoot,2,"""Scoot is a horrible choice""",2017-10-13,False,"  Bangkok to Kansai. Due to the fact that I was in a tour group, I couldn’t choose the airline I was flying. I wanted to fly Thai Airways, however that wasn’t possible. On a timeline scale, I reserved an extra ticket for my Mum in business, as it was on sale at the time. It was only $200 on the first sector, so we brought it. It would also benefit me and my brother by having an empty middle seat. Initially, I asked for an exit row, and got the best seat, 4J and 4H. However, the boarding passes they printed us were the flimsy receipt type. Once I got on board, the flight attendant at the door greets you,  and find out that there is someone occupying my seat. I call the purser, and she is unwilling to help and throws the responsibility at ground staff. They then say that this was a double seat assignment and that I had to sit in row 15. The seat itself isn’t appealing, and some short haul aircraft have better seats. I could’ve paid extra for seats with extra legroom, but since it was a group booking this had to be done at check in, and inevitably led to the double seat assignment. Luckily, the scheduled aircraft to fly this flight was a 2 month old 787. But the plane looked like it had suffered years of abuse! The most annoying thing also mentioned in previous reviews are the call button/light switch, awkwardly placed on the armrest. I understand the 787 doesn’t have call buttons on the ceiling, but can’t you find a better place for it? After takeoff, I order a lasagne and pasta for my brother. The lasagne tasted unappetising, while the pasta tasted really bland. A little bit later in the flight, I had Ice cream for dessert and also nachos prior to landing. All this food set me back 50 Singaporean dollars. The equivalent amount of food on AirAsia would only cost me a third as much, and also tastes better.  On the flight from Tokyo to Bangkok, the staff at the check in were friendly like Japanese people are, and I requested an extra legroom seat, and found out I wouldn’t be charged for it since the flight was overbooked. However, my brother wasn’t allowed to sit there, so we asked if he was allowed to sit in The “ScootInSilence” zone, which he wasn’t allowed to, even though he was 13 and the minimum age to sit there is 12. There was a lady and her daughter talking in Japanese in the counter next to us, and later in the flight, I saw her and her daughter (who looked like she was 10) sit in the scoot in silence zone which made me question if I had a language barrier, even though the guy at the counter wasn’t Japanese. The crew on this flight were much more friendly, but still considerably cold. I went to have some conversation in the galley, and after 2 minutes of pleasant conversation they all had their backs turned on me.

On my way back flying Palau to Taipeh I was the only passenger in C and the flight attendant did everything to keep my glass filled.  Food was good and plenty, the entertainment was good with many choices. I tested the onboard WLan which was alright, but not really needed. The lounge in Taipeh was comfortable and the shower highly appreciated. On my final leg to Vienna a (minor) medical incident occured and they looked for medical personnel.

As I connected from a domestic flight I went straight to the TK lounge which offered a wide array of food and beverages with ample seating and relaxation options. Boarding started one hour prior to take-off and, as with all TK flights, was chaotic and lacked proper handling by the gate agents. I was shocked to see that they did not bother to match my passport to my boarding pass. Onboard, the hard product was new and a welcome improvement in terms of privacy and aisle access. However, the seats are quite challenging to get in and out of and would pose a problem for passengers with a larger build. Following take-off we were given a drink menu and told that there would be no food menu and that we would be given an option to choose a main course only. When lunch was served, they simply brought a pre-plated tray with appetizer and dessert and no salad option. Unlike previous experiences on TK, there was no appetizer or dessert trolley and no soup offering. The catering was a significant downgrade from the standard TK had previously established and won accolades for. The food quality and taste was at best OK but drink options were good with champagne on offer. The seat was comfortable and offered lots of storage options but inability to set the foot and back rest to individual settings took some getting used to. IFE had plenty to choose from with the latest movies and music in their library. FA’s were quite attentive and went about their business with calm and poise instead of the frantic running around I had observed on several other flights. The flight took off slightly behind schedule but landed on time. The overall experience was OK but the downgrade in catering was a total disappointment.

Seats were uncomfortable (hard) and the seat on the second leg was broken so it wouldn't lock in recline mode (flight full, so no spares). The quality of the food was not good and out of the three meals over the journey, two of them had ran out of one of the two choices supposedly available, so locked into a dish I did not want. Whilst the crew were pleasant enough the service was really bare bones and seem to focus around the main meal times rather than between times.

When we arrived at the airport we were told that the flight had been overbooked and we were being downgraded to economy. Since the staff were aware we were travelling for a special occasion they kindly bought us a cake on the first flight IST-BAH (thanks to the airport manager at IST for kindly arranging this). The second flight from IST-BKK, stopped over in Singapore but the staff at check-in and the crew on the plane didn't really have any clue about the arrangements for this - as if they had no idea it was happening. Upon arriving in BKK (our final destination), our luggage did not arrive. It contained many items close to our hearts ... wedding gifts, cards written by family and friends, photos and memories that cannot be replaced. Gulf air customer service is a nightmare and they seem totally unwilling to help - I am trying to trace the baggage myself by calling the various airlines and talking to the ground services directly. I will not be flying Gulf Air again. Service is okay in Business class but could definitely be better, same goes with the lounge in BAH.

The only alcoholic pre-dinner drinks served on all flights was cans of Carlsberg larger, which leaves a lot to be desired. During our meals there was a choice of red or white wine.

Upon checking in to return was met with rude staff who commented ""don't even touch that it's hassle just refer her to ticketing"" where I spent the next two hours waiting for them to check me in. My flight closed and took off without me - despite me constantly stressing that I had a child with a fractured leg and medical assistance all linked to the flight. Long story short, I was dumped on next flight after 3 hours waiting at desk with 5 children, no explanation of what was going on - people being served all around me by person who was supposed to be dealing with me, no child meals were transferred and all assistance was abandoned as was connected with previous flight. Resulted in me being stranded at Heathrow as my 7 seater taxi had left and was impossible to book another. However this wasn't all - check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations. I had to throw away 8 kilos worth of clothing. This was despite me being 48 kilos under my overall baggage allowance and receiving a sticker labelled 'heavy bags must not weigh more than 32 kilos'. Had a further 3 hour wait at the other end as all medical assistance booked had not been transferred as requested.

All other flights in the airport resumed their operation by 5am. KLM forced those tired passengers to find accommodation yourself even if it is a covid 19 pandemic everywhere. Everyone needs RT PCR certificates. Most of those certificates going to expire on next day. Most of the people came to Mumbai from different parts of India in domestic flights. After making a lots of issues in airport at-last KLM agreed to book hotel for everyone. And then, hotel transportation was very poor, by 12 pm they only managed to accommodate not even half of the passengers. Then the airline rebooked ticket for every passengers, and it includes travelling via different countries, and transit visa required for those countries.

Last time I traveled with Lion Air I had paid an extra fee for the Lion Fast Service that offers exclusive check-in counter, priority boarding, seat on the first rows and priority claim bag. I would first like to compliment the staff of Lion Air office in Phuket Airport (second floor – I upgraded to Lion Fast with them). Very professional and polite and with a great smile. On the day of the flight I arrived at the airport an hour before departure and to my disappointment I found out there was no exclusive check-in counter for Lion Fast. I waited in line for around 25 minutes, when one of their staff members asked the passengers waiting if there was anyone that was flying to Phuket. I replied and she asked why I came so late. I replied that I had the Lion fast upgrade and I was expecting to be checked-in at the Lion fast counter. The only answer I received was a smile but 10 minutes later I was at the gate as they did their best to check me in for the flight as fast as they could. During boarding time and as I was preparing myself to hear the announcement for Lion Fast priority boarding, I heard “please proceed for boarding rows 24 to 36 first”. To my disappointment there was no priority boarding. The two flight attendants on board were very professional. The pre-booked meal was deliciously fresh and one of the best I have tasted. When I arrived at Phuket Airport, I was finally given priority to leave the aircraft and to my big surprise the ground staff were waiting for me (before the claim area) and gave me my luggage. From the gate to the exit of the airport it took me only 5 minutes. According to my experience they are selling a fairly good product at a competitive price. They are trying to make improvements but in small steps. I would give 3 stars to the airport and gate staff and 1 to the Bangkok staff although it is clear that the lack of fast check in of fast boarding is not their responsibility. I would give 5 stars to the Phuket staff. I hope Lion Air will consider introducing a frequent flyer program soon.
